        मध्यपश्चिमाञ्चल विकास क्षेत्रमा पर्ने प्यूठान जिल्ला एक पहाडी जिल्लाको रुपमा परिचित छ । जिल्लाका दुई ठूला नदीहरु माण्डवी र झिमरुकले जिल्लालाई दुई प्रष्ट भागमा विभाजन गरेका छन् । नेपालकै प्रशिद्ध तीर्थस्थल स्वर्गद्वारीको काख र माडीखोलाको किनारमा अवस्थित भिंग्री गा.वि.स.मा रहेका थुप्रै विद्यालयहरुमध्ये पुरानो इतिहास बोकेको एक मात्र उच्च मा.वि. हो, अमर उच्च मा.वि. भिंग्री । यो विद्यालय स्थापनाकालमा वडा नं. ३ मा खुले पनि पछि वडा नं. ५ मा विस्तार गरिएको छ । अर्थात् विद्यालयको प्रा.वि. तहको पठन पाठन वडा नं. ३ मा हुँदै आइरहेको छ भने नि.मा.वि., मा.वि. र उच्च मा.वि. तहको पठनपाठन वडा नं. ५ मा हुँदै आइरहेको छ । र, यी दुवै विद्यालय उपल्लो भिंग्री अर्थात् भालुवाङ–रोल्पा मोटरबाटोबाट करिव २०० मिटर टाढा पश्चिमतर्फ रहेका छन् ।
        प्यूठान जिल्ला एक मध्य पहाडी जिल्ला भएकोले पनि यस गा.वि.समा जिल्ला जस्तै हावापानी समशितोष्ण प्रकृतिको छ, अर्थात् यहाँ जाडोमा न धेरै जाडो र गर्मीमा न धेरै गर्मी हुन्छ ।
        यस गा.वि.स.को शैक्षिक स्थितिलाई हेर्दा सन्तोषजनक नै रहेको पाइन्छ । गा.वि.स.का धेरै व्यक्तिहरु उच्च शिक्षा हासिल गरेका, उच्च शिक्षाका लागि बाहिर गएका देखिन्छन् भने भिंग्री गा.वि.स.का जनताहरुमा छोराछोरी पढाउनु पर्छ भन्ने भावनाको विकास भइसकेकोले गाउँघरमा विद्यालय नजाने बालबालिकाहरु सून्य छन् भने साक्षरता अभियान, प्रौढ शिक्षा, महिला शिक्षाजस्तो अनौपचारिक शिक्षा दिने प्रणालीले पनि गाउँमा निरक्षरहरु कमै छन् ।

नेपालमा विविध किसिमका सम्पदाहरु रहेका छन । सम्पदाहरुको कुरा गर्दा मुख्यत प्राकृतिक, धार्मिक र सास्कृतिक गरी ३ किसिमबाट विभाजन गरी हेर्न सकिन्छ । बागलुङमा रहेको कालिका भगवतिको मन्दिर यस्तो ऐतिहासिक महत्व बोकेको स्थल हो जहा यी ३ वटै सम्पदाको मिस्रित रुप र महत्व रहेको क्षेत्र हो । यस्तो महत्व बोकेको स्थल नेपालमा कमै भेटिएलान । कालिका भगवती गुठी बहुमुखि सम्पदा र विषेश आस्थाको रमणिय केन्द्र विन्दुका रुपमा प्रख्यात छ ।

 

नेपाल अधिराज्यको धौलागिरी अंचलमा पर्ने बागलुङ जिल्ला नेपाल भित्रको सानो नेपालले चिनिन्छ । हुनत बागलुङ जिल्लालाई चिनाउने अन्य विभिन्न उत्पादन, स्थान र क्षेत्रहरु नभएका पनि होइनन । जस्तो झोलुङेपुल, बुट्टेनली, एक मात्र शिकार आरक्ष ( ढोरपाटन ) आदीले पनि यहाको पहिचान देश विदेशमा बढाएको छ । बागलुङको पहिचान भनेको यहाको ऐतिहासिक कालिका भगवतीको मन्दिर प्रमुख पहिचान हो । हरेक बर्षको चैत्राष्टमी (चैते दशैं)े राष्ट्रिय स्तरमै महत्वपुर्ण स्थान राख्ने मेला हो । यो मेला र कालिका भगवतीको ऐतिहासिक सम्वन्ध रहेको छ । यो मेलाले धार्मिकरुपमा मात्र नभएर आर्थिक, सामाजिक, सांस्कृतिक तथा राजनैतिकरुपमा पनि विषेश महत्व राख्ने गर्दछ ।

 

कालिका भगवती मन्दिरको ऐतिहासिक पृष्ठभूमि हेर्दा पर्वतका राजा प्रतापी नारायण मल्लको पाल्पाली राजा मुनि मुकुन्द सेनकी राजकुमारी विश्रवादेवीसंग विं.स.१५९१ मा विवाह हुंदा राजकुमारीले पाल्पा माझकी देवी (कालिका देवी) साथमा ल्याई यस पावन भूमिमा वैदिक विधिपूर्वक प्रतिष्ठापन गरिएको हो । कालिका देवी वेगर राजकुमारी एक क्षण पनि वस्न नसक्ने भएकीले विवाह गरी आउदा देवीलाई आप–नो वुवासंग मागि साथमा ल्याएकी हुन । श्रुतिस्मृति अनुसार राजकुमारीको विवाह पश्चात जन्ती पर्वत फिर्ता हुन लाग्दा दरबारमा कालिका देवीको खड्ग र डोली उठाउन कसैले पनि नसकेको अवस्थामा एकजना शिकारी भेषधारी व्यक्तिले डोली उठाउन सके । सो समयमा आप–नो कामको लागि पाल्पा पुगेका बागलुङ लुङगाउका मगरहरुले डोली बोके भने शिकारी भेषधारी व्यक्तिले खड्ग समाति आए । शिकारी भेषधारी खड्ग उठाउने ति व्यक्ति चक्र पुवार थिए ।

 

राजकुमारी यी कालिका देवीको अनन्यभक्त थिइन । भनिन्छ यिनले कालिका देवीको प्रत्यक्ष दर्शन पाउथिन । कालिका देवीलाई पहिला माझकीदेवी, कालि, कालिका, देवी, श्री देवी, माइस्थानको नामले पुकारेको पाइन्छ । कालिका देवीको वारेमा प्राप्त कागजातहरु र लालमोहरहरुमा भगवती भनि उल्लेख गरिएको देखिदैन । केही वर्ष पहिले देखि मात्र कालिका देवीको अर्काे नाम भगवति पुकारिन थालिएको हो । पर्वत राज्य विं.सं १८४३ मा नेपालमा गाभिएपछि विं.संं.१८४५ मा सरदार अमरसिंह थापाले पुजारी रामचन्द्र खड्काको नाममा गरिदिएको सनद जुन वि.सं.१८४८मा तत्कालिन श्री ५ महाराजधिराजबाट लालमहोहर भएको थियो ,यो लालमोहर नै खड्का पुजारीलाई प्राप्त पहिलो लालमहोहर देखिन आएको छ । वि.स.ं१८५९ सालमा श्री ५ महाराजधिराजबाट कृष्ण खड्का र जयविन्द खड्काको नाममा भएको लालमोहरमा बागलुङ चौरकी कालिका देवीको गुठ अक्षत्या चांफावोट षेत १ पाडाका तीन भाइका परिवारले पायाको बारी घडयारी तस्को साध पुर्व थाइलाको वृत्ता यति चार किल्लाभित्रको जगह समालको १४ पुस्तादेषी गुठ राष्याको रहेछ मुलुक मार्दा हाम्रा भारदारले जांची बुझी श्री बाज्यूका हजुरमा बिन्ती गरी थामी बक्स्याको रहेछ सोही लालमोहर बमोजिम हामीले पनि थामी बक्स्यौं भनी लेखिएको छ ।

 

राजा प्रतापी नारायण मल्लले पाल्पादेखि कालिका देवीको खड्ग समाती आउने चक्र पुवारलाई खड्गा पदवी दिई पुजारी गराई गुठ राखि दिए । सोही समय देखि यिनै चक्र पुवारका सन्तानहरु बागलुङका पुवार खड्का दाजुभाईहरुले हालसम्म अविच्छिन्न रुपमा कालिका देवीको पुजारी भई सेवा गरिरहेका छन । पारदर्शिता, सुरक्षा आदीका कारण खड्का समुदायले गुठी संस्थानसंग समन्वय गरी काम गर्न थालेको पाँइन्छ । २०३२ सालदेखि गुठी संस्थानको सामान्य रेखदेख र नियन्त्रणमा कालिका भगवती मन्दिरको संचालन भैरहेको छ ।

","""""","""Uniting Youth From The Whole World ""","***************** ABOUT NEPAL ******************* 	 

Nepal is a small but beautiful country squeezed in between India and China. With a land mass no bigger than Tasmania in Australia, Nepal still manages to provide amazing contrasts - from the Indian border with flat and fertile plains only 100m above sea level; to amazing jungles with tigers and rhinos running wild; and of course to the magnificent 8000m-high mountain range, the Himalayas. 

The Himalayas are a breathtaking vista of awesome snow-capped mountains, including the world's tallest - Mount Everest. Nepal's mountains make it a very popular destination for mountaineers and trekkers alike. The fast flowing rivers and steep rock faces also place Nepal high on the list of adventure tourism destinations.

Nepal's physical beauty is matched by the rich cultural diversity of her traditions and people. Nepal's population currently stands at more than 23 million people, the majority of whom are Hindu.
Nepal is also the birthplace of the Buddha and Buddhism and Buddhist traditions are very strong.  In fact, many of the religious celebrations are a mix of Hinduism and Buddhism and have been that way for many centuries.

Despite its beauty, Nepal is a very poor country, with serious issues of poverty, including infant and child mortality, malnutrition, lack of access to safe drinking water, poor sanitation, illiteracy and preventable diseases. In this setting other serious issues have arisen such as human trafficking, child abuse and child labour. Nepal's environment is also suffering from pollution, deforestation and unregulated use of natural resources. 

Additionally, and unfortunately for Nepal and her people, a serious internal conflict ravaged the country from 1991 until a ceasefire was declared in 2006. During the conflict more than 13,000 Nepali men, women and children lost their lives and there has been terrible destruction to infrastructure, including many schools, roads and hospitals. It will take Nepal many years to recover.

The rural areas were particularly hard hit by the civil war, where the conflict together with abject poverty made life incredibly difficult. Hardest hit have been the children, as poverty and conflict make life cheap and children’s needs are often neglected. It is not uncommon for a widow or widower to remarry and subsequently abandon one or all of the children from the previous marriage - sometimes with relatives, oftentimes not.

Its creation arises from a crucial need people face in our modern society and that is unity.
It involves a residency in the unique Himalayas, an active society of members supporting and guiding its steps into the future and the power of art itself.
Upon its completion it will provide members from all over the world a new home to come to and express themselves. Different worlds combined will unleash the power of humanity's  artistic side, giving a new perspective of living.
There is now a choice. 


About

The artists society of Himalayas development depends on the willingness of people to create a place, an idea like The Ash.  A place where every member has a home and is free to express his art form. Starting from Nepal we will build a self-sustainable residency in the foothills of the Himalayas, where Earth’s biggest mountains rest.

We'll provide a land big enough to house our Himalayan residency.  Research in the field of sustainable living has given us knowledge on how to construct our buildings and shape our land.
The Ash will be formed out of multiple styles buildings using the local wisdom of construction by the natural materials stone, soil and wood. Our first priority is to protect the natural environment that will accommodate us.
The formation of the land, providing our food, will be done using permaculture. It is a technique allowing nature to use her power with a minimum of human input, creating and maintaining a food forest. Members living will have all their organic food produced right on the spot with a minimum of work.
An academy will be formed with our members sharing knowledge and in the same time en-change? their horizon.
Useful modern infrastructure like internet will of course be available to connect with the world.

The Ash is it's members !

Our mission is two-fold. Local and global. We aim to preserve and create upon the already beautiful surrounding nature an ecological farm community which will be a fine example for people around the world who are inquisitive about organic food, and living. We believe that in these times it is clearly imperative that humanity take seriously the efforts to address the problems of the world caused by contaminated foods, and natural resources. The solution we feel, as many do, is to preserve and expand the awareness and produce of the organic culture. Foods produces organically, meaning they are not contaminated with chemicals, antibiotics, or neither modified genetically (GMO) are healthier, tastier and friendly to the environment.
Connected already with local farmers we mean to establish a center for educating more and more people in the practical application of organic farming. Their knowledge of the land and of techniques of farming passed down the ages are to be consciously preserved. Uniting with this will be knowledge brought in from other sources around the world as we aim to gather knowledge regarding the organic agri-culture. We will market and distribute accordingly.
By bringing attention to organic farming we will create awareness of its importance and its science all over the world. We have plans to advertise through many mediums the importance of good food, and natural living, not only in Nepal but throughout the world. Presenting ourselves in festivals around the world we will not only bring attention to the cause of organic farming but to Nepal itself, thereby giving good representation in the growing field of sustainable living.
As our local concern is Nepal, we will be working with local farmers to raise the standard of living in the rural areas. In this way, other non-organic farms may take note and decide to become organic. To assist with this we will develop our site into a working sustainable community.
The community, which will not be isolated but integrated with the locality, will create schools for adults and for children. The school for adults will be to educate all who desire the education regarding organic farming etc. Also we will teach many subjects such as health preservation and care, ayurveda, yoga etc along with standard education subjects such as mathematics, English and science. In this way, the locals teach and are taught, and visitors invited for sharing we teach and be taught. These sharing schools will contribute to the preservation of knowledge in our future society.
Such a school, created locally in Nepal, may then be forged again and again in other areas, in Nepal and also around the world.
We will create also a school for children and invite poor and orphaned children to come and study. Again the subjects studied will be a mix of practical, spiritual, and social.
One aim of our project is for our children to be content with their beautiful home, so they feel proud with no need to leave for foreign lands for education or entertainment.
On the contrary, we will instead receive folks from all over the world who wish to absorb the local culture while simultaneously creating a new culture which is a blend of old and new.
Entertainment will also therefore is also an important concern, for teenagers have a natural need, and a natural thirst for enjoyment and creation. We will create for them a music studio, and bring in teachers of music from Nepal and all around the world. In this way local music traditions may be preserved and foreign traditions may be received and integrated, with no need of travelling far.
As well as a studio we aim to create art schools and craft schools within the community, again, preserving and educating locals and visitors about our culture.
Alongside the practical is also the spiritual. We will create space for the teaching of spiritual sciences such as yoga and meditation. Such places will not be merely utilized for show but to educate those interested in this regard so they may continue the teachings of a rich heritage.
All-in-all we aim to create a wonderful community where people are happy to co-exist, in nature. The success of this will surely be an education to anyone who recognizes as we do the problems created by separating the city life from the rural life, where farmers farm with no access to other community activities. In this way rural living will again be desired and our children will not wish to run to cities around the world where a struggle to compete with millions of people for money awaits them.
We wish to share these ideas and creations with the people of Nepal and also inspire local people around the world to enjoy local living, and resurrect it in the minds of people, so that our food becomes predominantly organic again, so that our usage of pollutants becomes minimized, so that our health and happiness be with us constantly.
We engage various workshops where local Nepali people as well as people from around the world will present their original crafts and skills, lecture on ancient Yoga and meditation techniques, New Age life style green ways, recycling, composting and how to contribute for the preservation of the Nature and Mother Earth.
Ghaderi Eco Village is nestled in the hills over-looking Pokhara, bearing constant witness to the magnificent Annapurna ranga. It is a cosy village where locals grow there own organic food and live a happy life. It is a piece of heaven. Upon that ready heaven there is further ambition to cultivate a culture where much more than farming is seen. What the local life can teach is much yet children brought up in these villages still yearn for the adventures of the city and so the youth more often than not leave in search for another type of heaven. One that invariably does not exist.
The goal of Ghaderi Eco Village is to bring awareness to the world of the heaven that exists in these rurals communities, and invite people to experience this first hand. Also we desire to rejuvenate the local scene by sharing ideas from all over the world.
Thus we have Permaculture meeting with local culture, western traditional music meeting with local traditional music, and the convergence of other arts and philosophies such as yoga, meditation, reiki, massage etc.
What is being created is the future. A merger of east and west, of new and old, of earth and spirit. We aim to build a school nearby which hosts local children and children visiting from all around the world, so that knowledge and love may be shared. We aim to establish an ashram and invite teachers to teach various subjects from all fields of esoteric study. We will create a music studio so that musicians from all around the world are attracted to come and enjoy the perfect place to create music of all types. And so that locals may produce sounds the world may also hear.
Ghaderi Eco Village is therefore not an isolated experiment but the creation of future upon what has been preserved so well from ages. The locals are happy to see new colors, and visitors are happy to experience the hospitality of the locals and the sheer beauty of the place. We invite you to join us in our growth, in our uniting, in our sharing and creating of what must surely be an example for humanity. In these times it is essential to retrace our steps and apply natural wisdom in our future culture on Planet Earth. Where that respect for nature is let us maintain it, and from whose hearts that respect lies, let it be shared.
We will host different kinds of festivals here and hope to see you one day, sharing what you know and learning what you may not.
In unity we thus grow, and enjoy abundantly in this heaven in the hills.

The institution offers undergraduate and graduate programs. It is named after the king Prithivi Narayan Shah credited for the unification of Nepal in its modern form.HistoryThe campus, initially named Prithivi Narayan College, was established in Sept. 1, 1960 as the first community college of the Kaski district for post secondary education as a local effort. In its initial years the classes were conducted in Ratna Rajya Laxmi High School. In 1961 it was granted public land in Bhimkali Patan, Bagar where it currently exists. Regarded as one of the largest affiliate campuses of Tribhuvan University (TU) it is a major center for post secondary education in the western region of the country.The campus is regarded as one of the important educational institutions in the country and receives government grants distributed through the TU. In accordance with the TU decentralization act of 1998 the campus elected a management committee in Sept. 1999 which handles tasks such as construction of physical infra-structure, making rules, working plan and economic policies and a sub committee under the management committee looks after every day affairs of the campus. The campus is spread over 35 hectares along on the banks of the Seti Gandaki River. The campus buildings occupy only a part of this area; most of the land owned is open. In 2006, UNDP Global Environmental funded a project to develop this open space as Green Space Park, where university students could learn about environmental conservation and demonstrate the use of open space to serve the leisure and recreational needs of the growing urban population of Pokhara.

We are both intrepid world travelers always looking for unique experiences to share with a global audience. We have outgoing personalities and fluency in several languages, which helps us quickly develop trust with local people. We hope to inspire travelers of all ages to expand their geographic and cultural boundaries. We have travelled off the beaten path in more than 60 countries. Our recent trip to Nepal exceeded all our expectations! Why? Because we had the absolute good fortune to meet the Malla sisters in Pokhara.

The Malla Dynasty ruled Nepal from the 12th to 16th centuries. 

At that time the name Malla indicated a person of great strength and power! In many ways the Malla period of rule in Nepal was much like the Italian Renaissance … Just visit Patan and walk amongst the many temples to understand that. Much like the extraordinary temples in Pagan the Malla sisters themselves are a hidden treasure waiting to be discovered – and to our everlasting pleasure we discovered them in Pokhara.

Over a two week period we trekked in the Himalayas, biked in Pokhara, visited Para Gliding sites including the unbelievable para hawking experience with Steve & Anita Mason, boated and hiked above on Lake Begnas, took in the best museums in Pokhara…. all under the guidance and loving care of the Malla sisters …. Hira & Bishnu!

They are both not only competent … but incredibly fun to be with! This video is dedicated to them. They made our experience in Nepal a great success. Bravo!

It is the place where, according to Buddhist tradition, Queen Mayadevi gave birth to Siddhartha Gautama in 623 BCE. Gautama, who achieved nirvana some time around 543 BCE, became the Gautama Buddha and founded Buddhism after achieving Enlightenment. Lumbini is one of many magnets for pilgrimage that sprang up in places pivotal to the life of Gautama Buddha; other notable pilgrimage sites include Kushinagar, Bodh Gaya and Sarnath.Lumbini has a number of temples, including the Mayadevi Temple and several others which are still under construction. Many monuments, monasteries and a museum — the Lumbini International Research Institute — are also located within the holy site. Also located there is the Puskarini or Holy Pond where the Buddha's mother took the ritual dip prior to his birth and where he, too, had his first bath. At other sites near Lumbini, earlier Buddhas were, according to tradition, born, achieved ultimate Enlightenment and finally relinquished their earthly forms.Lumbini was granted World Heritage status by UNESCO in 1997.","""""","""""","""""","""""","""""",City,"""""","""""",""""""

Dear all,
Thank you so much for all the support you have offered to my family and me during this difficult time. I know it couldn't have been easy and I really appreciate your kindness.

Roshan Nepal, a graduate of Masters on Civil Engineering from Lamar University, Beaumont, Texas and working as a Civil Engineer, passed away in a fatal car accident on November 10, 2013. After serving as a Water Resources Engineer for Rural Village Water Resources Management Project for more than 3 years, he headed to the United States on August 2010 with a hope to his family, relatives & friends. 

I still can’t believe that we will have to live with the fact that he would no longer be around us. I have no words to explain how much bereaved me and my family are at this moment. Of all the love and affection he shared with us, it would never be enough to what we can do on behalf of Roshan. But still to express the love towards him and feel his presence around us until we live, me and my family have decided to establish a trust on his behalf which would be used for grants & scholarships to qualified students back in Nepal. 

Roshan did have many dreams which he could not make it. But I believe, this foundation on his behalf would help someone have their dreams come true. I would hereby encourage all of you to be a part of this noble cause and express your generosity for the greater good.

Please start here, http://roshannepalspn.org

Thanks and kindest Regards,
Ravi Nepal & Family

The village is surrounded by Chovar in the east, Taudaha in the south, Kirtipur in the north and Jakha in the west. Charghare's main tourist places are Jalpadevi Temple and slopy land (फाँट). It covers the area of 4 or 5 km2. (approx.). Around 90 houses are found here. The population of this village is about 470. Houses are of traditional type but new houses are constructed in modern style. Most people are engaged in Agriculture and Trade.HistoryThere isn't any accurate information or documents that have been found on the origin of village. When, the village was established is still unknown because of insufficient sources of knowledge. It is believed that the village originated during the period of the Unification Campaign by King Prithvi Narayan Shah. The King's main aim was to capture the Kathmadu Valley, but to win Kathmandu Valley over he had to defeat the Kirtipur Valley. So he brought a large number of troops from the west to attack the Kirtipur Valley. But he failed twice to take over city. After a heavy loss of troops and his 'right-hand' Kalu Pandey, he started to conquer the small states around Kirtipur to impose economic strike. During those days Charghare was unnamed and open plain land. Some people migrated or mar be troops who has came for battle form western part who started to settlement with the four houses(चार घर) in village. Later pronounced of Char ghar(चार घर) changed into Charghare(चारघरे) which consequenced the name of village as Charghare.

Triggered by the Climate Change negotiation processes as well as on the basis of the importance of South Asian countries’ effective presence in those negotiations, CANSA envisaged that without creating a credible niche for South Asian civil societies, it would not be possible to make a dent in “Climate Change and development” discourse. In that regard, strategically CANSA has moved very fast in activity mode in recent years...

With organisational member of 60 NGOs in 6 countries of South Asia, one of the major strategies of CANSA has been to outreach civil societies in all South Asian countries. This process has been guided by two broad objectives: establishing a strong voice of South Asia in negotiations and contributing to CAN international policy advocacy and lobby work; secondly, targeting SAARC towards a regional cooperation at least from Climate Change perspectives. Country level lead organizations initiated high profile activities and this is leading to having an acknowledged platform on climate change issues.

Just located in the outskirts of the valley Seto Gumba is a panoramic kaleidoscope of colors and rich culture that showcases the valley in the most spectacular way. Looking at it from a traveler’s point of view Seto Gumba is bliss of astounding natural rejuvenation that searches excitement as well as calmness. Endorsed with a rich Tibetan culture and architecture, it splurges vivid colors in the murals, statue and paintings professing Buddhism and its techniques. One can get nostalgic in the presence of finding and seeing the explicit environment that melds you in its presence. Winds shouting out loud the music of scenic views and panoramic existence makes you think of what life and you will lose time in absence. Once you get here you will be abided by the smell, sounds and prayer flags that spread around the message of peace, patience, and calmness. The more interesting are the visuals that overlook the valley in a synchronizing way of contouring the old cultural heritage with the increasing encroachment of the concrete jungle. It is also a popular hiking destination for tourists.The abstraction of the valley can be well judged from there that looks colorful, glossy and glamorous. Regarding food and beverages, the white monastery has a well facilitated and clean restaurant that serves decent food items with a catered service. Low priced and healthy, one can really enjoy the taste and price to the optimum level. With a minimum of NRS 40 as a registration fee Seto Gumba is worth spending time.

A enorme e maciça estupa de Boudhanath, que domina o horizonte a nordeste do centro da cidade, de que dista 11 km, é uma das maiores estupas semi-esféricas do mundo e o templo budista tibetano mais sagrado do mundo fora do Tibete.O afluxo de um elevado número de refugiados do Tibete à zona levou à construção de mais de 50 gompas (mosteiros budistas tibetanos) em volta da estupa. Desde 1979 que Boudhanath está inscrito na lista do Património Mundial da UNESCO, por integrar o sítio ""Vale de Catmandu"". Juntamente com o templo e estupa de Swayambhunath, é um dos locais mais populares entre os turistas que visitam a área de Catmandu.DescriçãoA estupa propriamente dita — uma torre quadrangular dourada que se ergue 36 metros acima do nível da praça onde se encontra — assenta sobre um enorme bahal, uma grande plataforma branca com três níveis em forma de mandala, aproximadamente circular, com 120 metros de diâmetro, que aparentemente foi inspirada por uma existente em Gyantse, no Tibete. A plataforma ocupa o centro de uma grande praça circular, rodeada de casas habitadas por famílias tibetanas e lojas de recordações. A praça é sempre percorrida no sentido dos ponteiros do relógio, seguindo a tradição budista tibetana.

Small Magar settlements and Individual farmsteads are also found elsewhere in Nepal, as well as in Sikkim and even in north India. This pattern of distribution in part reflects the excellence of Magar men as infantrymen. In the late eighteenth century Magars formed an important component in the armies raised by Prithivi Narayan Shah and his successors who created the modern nation of Nepal and for a time extended it well beyond its present borders both to the east and to the west. A number of families now living outside the area of Magar concentration occupy land given a forebear as a reward for his military service during these campaigns. Under the British Raj, when Magars served as mercenaries in the Gurkha Brigade, a few families settled Permanently in north India around the cantonment areas. Magars in need of land have also been moving south to the low malarial Terai of Nepal, since it has been made more habitable by a mosquito eradication program.Magars usually identify themselves as belonging through patrilineal inheritance to a named section or ""tribe,"" which in the traditional Nepali system is also a caste. Some of these are Pun, Gharti, Rana, Thapa, Ale, Rokha(ya), Budha, Burathoki, and Jhankri.

As it is said that a leader is born with the birth of every child. The only need is to provide an enabling environment, careful nurturing, and a spring board for meaningful blossoming, honoring and effective use of unbound talents.

The Student Care of Nepal  intends to fill this void for young minds to unleash their unparalleled innovative ideas. Student care of Nepal helps students realize their dream and invests in the development process, thus guiding them the way parents and teachers do.

Success is measured by the involvement of the person’s passion, dedication and emotional attachment to work. 

To get something we must loose something but to people who have nothing to loose don’t they have any rights to desire their dream ?

Also known as Bhadgaon or Khwopa, it is an ancient Newar city in the east corner of the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal, about from the capital city, Kathmandu. It is located in Bhaktapur District in the Bagmati Zone.Bhaktapur was the largest of the three Newar kingdoms of the Kathmandu Valley, and was the capital of Nepal during the great 'Malla Kingdom' until the second half of the 15th century. Today it is the third largest city in the Kathmandu Valley, with a population of more than 80,000, of which the vast majority are still Newars. Historically more isolated than the other two kingdoms, Kathmandu and Patan, Bhaktapur has a distinctly different form of Nepal Bhasa language.Bhaktapur has the best preserved palace courtyards and old city center in Nepal, and is listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO for its rich culture, temples, and wood, metal and stone artworks. This is supported by the restoration and preservation efforts of German-funded Bhaktapur Development Project (BDP).The city is famous for special type of curd called ""Ju Ju(king) dhau(curd). It is experienced by the curd makers that the taste of curd prepared in this location cannot be found elsewhere all over Nepal.EtymologyKHWOPA is the ancient name of Bhaktapur. The term ""Bhaktapur"" (Sanskrit/Nepali: भक्तपुर) refers to ""The City Of Devotees"". This Bhaktapur City is also known as ""Khwopa"" (Nepal Bhasa: ख्वप) or ""Bhadgaon"" (Nepali:भादगाँउ) or ""Ancient Newari Town"" throughout the Kathmandu Valley. ""Kh0apa"" actually refers to the masks which are believed to have been worn by gods and goddesses. Bhaktapur is popular for different forms of mask dances based on lives of different deities and therefore, it was named ""Khwapa"" which later came to become just ""Khwopa,"" which is also near to meaning masks.","""""","""""","""""","""""","""""",City,"""""","""""",""""""

Dating back to 1702 AD, the colossal five-storied edifice is the country’s tallest pagoda temple. The struts, doors, windows and tympanums—each embellished with attractively carved divine figures—perfectly portray the creative tradition of Newar craftsmen. The temple is dedicated to Goddess Siddhi Laxmi, the manifestation of female force and creativity. The latest major renovation of this monument was carried out in 1997 AD by Bhaktapur Municipality using the revenue it collected from tourists.

Next to the Nyataponla Temple is the rectangular shaped Bhairavnath Temple. It houses a gilded bust of Bhairav, the ferocious manifestation of Lord Shiva. The three-storied pagoda was razed to the grounds by the 1934-earthquake, and its latest renovation was undertaken by Bhaktapur Municipality in 1995 AD.

The enclosed complex facing the Nyataponla Temple is dedicated to Tilmadhav Narayan, a manifestation of Lord Vishnu, who is one of the Supreme Triumvirate of Hindu pantheon. A few steps ahead it, to the southwest, lies the famous Pottery Square, where visitors can see the city’s well-known potters making variously shaped and sized earthenware. The major monumental highlight of this square is a temple of Jeth Ganesh, which dates back to the 14th century.

Bhaktapur is one of the most important ancient cities of Nepal. It is recognized as a home of medieval art and architecture. It has religious, historical and natural significance.
               Bhaktapur city was founded by King Anand Dev in 889 AD (MoIC, 2000). It is about 15 km east of Kathmandu and is spread over an area of about 5 sq. kms, at an elevation of 1401 masl.	 Foreign scholars and historians have praised the city as a museum of ancient art and architecture of the Newar community. Impressed by the art and architecture, Moran (1996) wrote, ""The city remains a superb example of the Newars' instinctive mastery of urban planning. Despite an urban population density exceeding that of Tokyo or New York, Bhaktapur feels remarkably uncrowded and orderly. Thanks to the masterful structuring of urban space.  

Bhaktapur city is one of the best models of sustainability in the world. From the agricultural inputs to the daily consumable goods (like clothing, food and building materials), the society in Bhaktapur was self sufficient and very sustainable.
In the spirit of sustainability and preserving the culture of this beautiful city, Thagu Chhen was conceptualized. It was a small piece of ancestral land of the Pradhanang family whose roots are from Bhaktapur. It was initiated to set an example of preserving culture with commercial viability and sustainability, which could then be replicated and propogated in a bigger way to make Bhaktapur a better and prosperous place.

The building is a perfect example of a modern building combining traditional influences. The exposed brick façade meant, there was no need to paint the walls, which add an earthiness and russet warmth to the house. The façade has been designed to give the look which reflects symmetry and balance. The building tends to commercialize by means of total four apartment suites. These apartment suites aim to deliver some quality living spaces. The design is such that, there is a feeling of smooth flux within inner and outer spaces. The main concept of the design was to penetrate light into the building avoiding passages and providing open spaces and balconies for improved light and ventilation. The wide panels of glass in the northern side, separating the outer spaces with the inner one, connect them visually. The northern side provides a panoramic view of the Himalayan range from a dropdown height of approximately forty feet from the ground level of the house.
The house is not opulent , but exudes elegant simplicity. Whatever decorations are there, they have been inbuilt into the construction. There are no extra design features, be it the strategically placed niches, ‘thams’ (decorative wooden pillars) or the domical alcove in the ground floor. All the living quarters face south, to catch the winter sun and traditional skirt roof shields the windows from the slanting rain. The kitchens and bathrooms are bright and elegantly simple, and furnished with all the modern amenities. The floor is done in local ‘telia’ tiles which provide not just good insulation, but also give an earthy traditional feel. The visual association between the living, dining and kitchen has an impression of modernized living spaces, yet the interior depicts plenty of elements from Newari architecture that blends the difference between the two. 
The material usages also in the building have its influences from the Newari architectural style. The wooden carvings, the exposed brickwork, the classical traditional niches, the wooden staircases and the intricately carved windows and ‘Thams’, all try to conserve and preserve the Newari culture by their mere presence. Moreover, all the bricks used in the house are reclaimed bricks collected from old dilapidated houses which were centuries old. Even the intricately carved wooden pillars called ‘Tham’ and the big central window called ‘San jhya:’ which is approximately two centuries old, are reclaimed from dismantled houses from different parts of the valley.
The topmost level houses a laundry space for the inhabitants along with a small apartment suite. There are two levels of terraces which provide a resting space as well as a breathtaking 3600 view of the Bhaktapur city.
SUSTAINABLE FEATURES USED IN THE BUILDING
“ REDUCE , REUSE and RECYCLE” This is the main theme with which Thagu chhen  has been designed.
MANPOWER EFFICIENCY:
The hotel industry is notorious for hiring outsiders in almost every country in the world, but one factor that contributes to a hotel’s sustainability rating is their use of local labor. The more a hotel hires from the indigenous population, the more it is contributing to the local economy and making it more self sufficient. Thagu Chhen is proud to have local staffs for serving the guests and giving the essence of Newari culture of this ancient city of Bhaktapur.
MATERIAL EFFICIENCY:
Locally sourced and manufactured materials like ‘telia’ bricks, wooden carvings from Bhaktapur save a lot of embodied energy used in the manufacturing, shipping and packaging of products.
Not only that, use of reclaimed bricks, wooden carved pillars and windows, has lowered the amount of resources needed to produce these materials.
Glass, metal, steel, aluminum, bricks, wood, etc being green materials, are easy to reuse and recycle over and over again without losing any quality. Thus, usage of these same materials along with reclaimed bricks, pillars and windows, recycled furniture, cushions and straw mats and local ‘telia’ bricks, ‘dachi apa’ bricks and ‘Jhingati’ tiles have made the house more material efficient.

ENERGY EFFICIENCY:
Lighting is provided through the use of LED (Light Emitting Diodes) & CFLs (Compact Fluorescent Lamps) which are very energy efficient. The windows and the roof overhangs have been oriented as such to shade windows during the summer while maximizing solar gain in the winter. In addition, effective window placement (day lighting) in the northern side provides more natural light and lessens the need for electric lighting during the day. Solar water heating further ensures twenty four hours of hot water supply and reduces energy costs.
WATER  EFFICIENCY:
Rainwater harvesting is done by channeling roof water precipitation into an underground tank at site which is then filtered via a bio-sand filtration before being used at the house.
The wastewater treatment plant has also been designed so that the waste water (grey water) can be recycled and reused as well. Thus, the only water that flows out of the house is the one that is flushed out from the cistern. Rest of the water is recycled inside the house reducing the amount of water consumption.
All in all, this is a small initiation from the Pradhanang family to preserve and showcase Newari culture and architecture, while also being very sustainable and functional in the modern sense.

It is affiliated to Pokhara University. nec received Nepal's best engineering college award in 2014 presented by Oxford summit of leaders, London.HistoryNepal Engineering College was established in 1994 as a non profit institution under private sector initiative. The foundation of nec was laid by few visionary Nepalese professionals and academicians who realized the need of an institution serving the technical education needs of the country for accelerated economic growth, reaching to wider section of Nepalese students and making the quality technical education accessible and affordable to the masses. This pioneering example set by nec led to the establishment of a number of engineering colleges in the country in the private sector in the later years. It is one and only engineering college in Nepal with an ISO standard certificate. Also, the visionaries had an adapt knowledge of the easy money that could be churned out of the education industry in this country. Henceforth they came up with an idea of an engineering college in an isolated area. nec meets all the standard of a complete engineering college and its products are well scattered in the market as very competent employees in some reputed organisations, many of the students from nec are pursuing master's and PhD colleges abroad like USA, Australia and Europe as well.

Also known as Bhadgaon or Khwopa, it is an ancient Newar city in the east corner of the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal, about from the capital city, Kathmandu. It is located in Bhaktapur District in the Bagmati Zone.Bhaktapur was the largest of the three Newar kingdoms of the Kathmandu Valley, and was the capital of Nepal during the great 'Malla Kingdom' until the second half of the 15th century. Today it is the third largest city in the Kathmandu Valley, with a population of more than 80,000, of which the vast majority are still Newars. Historically more isolated than the other two kingdoms, Kathmandu and Patan, Bhaktapur has a distinctly different form of Nepal Bhasa language.Bhaktapur has the best preserved palace courtyards and old city center in Nepal, and is listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO for its rich culture, temples, and wood, metal and stone artworks. This is supported by the restoration and preservation efforts of German-funded Bhaktapur Development Project (BDP).The city is famous for special type of curd called ""Ju Ju(king) dhau(curd). It is experienced by the curd makers that the taste of curd prepared in this location cannot be found elsewhere all over Nepal.EtymologyKHWOPA is the ancient name of Bhaktapur. The term ""Bhaktapur"" (Sanskrit/Nepali: भक्तपुर) refers to ""The City Of Devotees"". This Bhaktapur City is also known as ""Khwopa"" (Nepal Bhasa: ख्वप) or ""Bhadgaon"" (Nepali:भादगाँउ) or ""Ancient Newari Town"" throughout the Kathmandu Valley. ""Kh0apa"" actually refers to the masks which are believed to have been worn by gods and goddesses. Bhaktapur is popular for different forms of mask dances based on lives of different deities and therefore, it was named ""Khwapa"" which later came to become just ""Khwopa,"" which is also near to meaning masks.","""""","""""","""""","""""","""""",City,"""""","""""",""""""

खस क्षेत्रीको ऐतिहासिक साँस्कृतिक धार्मिक जातीय पृष्ठभूमि
आदीवासी÷जनजातिमा सूचिकृत र खसान राज्यको माग

खस क्षेत्रीका विषयमा आन्दोलन एक विवेचना नामक आफ्नो पुस्तकमा 

खस जातिका विषयमा अध्ययन गर्दा धार्मिक ग्रन्थमा उल्लेखित मिथकीय प्रस्तुतिलाई विश्वास गर्न नसकिए पनि त्यहाँ उल्लेखित जातिको नाम बसाई र वर्णनले ऐतिहासिक सामग्रीको काम गर्दछ । प्रस्तुत लेखमा पौराणिक ग्रन्थ पश्चिमा इतिहासकार बि्रटिश भारतीय गजेटर नेपाली इतिहासकार र समाजशास्त्रीले खस जातिका विषयमा टिप्पणी गरेको उल्लेख छ । मनुस्मृतिमा खस जातिलाई किरात लगायत अनार्य जातिलाई एकै ठाउँमा राख्दै संस्कारबाट खसेको गायत्री मन्त्र जप नगर्ने वृषल या सुद्र भाव प्राप्त गरेको क्षत्रीयका रुपमा चिनाउन खोजेको पाइन्छ भनेर उहाँ भन्नुहुन्छ । 

खसका विषयमा शोध गर्ने भारतीय विद्वानमा अग्रस्थानमा डा। लक्ष्मीदत्त जोशी पर्दछन् । उनको अनुसन्धानात्मक पुस्तक द खसस फेमिली ल मा खस ककेसस जातिका मानिस हुन् जो वेद ग्रन्थ या वैदिक रिति रिवाज विकास हुनु पूर्व उत्तर भारतमा आए । वैदिक रिति रिवाज भन्दा खसका जो रिति रिवाज फरक छन भन्दै घर ज्वाईं झडकेलो सौतवांड टेकुवा जस्ता खसका सामाजिक मान्यता छ । 

डोरबहादुर विष्टका अनुसार आज भन्दा ६ हजारदेखि १० हजार वर्ष पहिले खस नेपालको पश्चिमी पहाडि भूमागमा आएको हुनु पर्दछ । डा।सूर्यमणि अधिकारीका अनुसार खस साम्राज्य नेपालको इतिहाँसमा सबैभन्दा ठूलो साम्राज्य थियो । यसले वीर योद्धा जातिको किर्तिमान नै कायम गरेको थियो । नेपालीहरुले यहाँ आफनो वाणी विकास गरेका थिए । यो साम्राज्य नै नेपालीपनको निर्माता थियो । त्यसैगरी उहाँले खस जातिको आफ्नै खरोष्ट लिपी रहेकेा विशिष्ट धार्मिक एवं साँस्कृतिक मान्यताहरु रहेको उल्लेख गर्नु भएको छ । 

खस क्षेत्री एकता समाज के हो 
खस क्षेत्री एकता समाज पनि निश्चित रुपमा एउटा जातीय संगठन नै हो । जाति भन्नाले नेपाली भाषाको शब्दले थुप्रै अर्थ बुझाउँदछ । जस्तै कि अनुवांसिकी जात जसलाई अंग्रेजीमा Race भनिन्छ । त्यस्तै वर्ण व्यवस्थाको जात जसलाई अंग्रेजीमा caste भनिन्छ । त्यस्तै समाज विकासको एउटा अवस्था जसलाई अंग्रेजीमा Nation नेपालीमा राष्ट्र भनिन्छ । हामीले उठाएको जातीय सवाल भनेको यही Nation या Nationality को सवाल हो । यो विशुद्ध नृस्संवितृय जात Race या वर्ण व्यवस्थाको जात caste को सवाल होइन । 

खस क्षेत्री वा क्षेत्री मात्रै 

क्षेत्री शब्द परम्परागत वर्ण व्यवस्थाको क्षत्रीयकै नेपालीकरण हो । नेपालका खस क्षेत्रीहरुले १२ औं शताब्दीदेखि मात्र वर्ण व्यवस्था अपनाएर क्षेत्री बनेका हुन । यस भूमिमा उनीहरु ह्जारौं वर्षसम्म रहँदा वस्दा खस नामले मात्र सुपरिचित थिए । मात्र क्षेत्री शब्दले भूमिसँगको यस्तो यो हज्जारौं वर्ष पुरानो गौरवपूर्ण इतिहासलाई इन्कार गरेर खस क्षेत्रीको परिचय अधुरो अस्पष्ट र भ्रामक हुन पुग्दछ । यसैले क्षेत्री मात्र भनेर पूर्ण परिचय दिन नमिल्ने हुनाले खस क्षेत्री भन्नैपर्दछ । क्षेत्री शब्दले वर्ण व्यवस्थाको वर्ण वा जात बुझाउने खसले यहाँको भूमिको रैथाने समुदाय अर्थात आदिवासी÷जनजाति बुझाउने भएकाले समूहगत पूर्ण परिचय र अस्तित्व पहिचानका लागि खस क्षेत्रीनै भन्नुपर्छ । 

खस भनेको के हो 

हुनत संस्कृतका पुस्तकमा खस भनेको व्रात्य पापी यक्ष म्लेच्छ जस्ता नामले चिनाउने कोशिस गरेको पाइन्छ । अझ मनुस्मृतिमा संस्कार खसेको या तल झरेको जाति पनि भनिएको छ । त्यसैले कतिपय मानिस खस भनेको आर्यबाट संस्कार खस्केको जाति भनेर चिनाउन रुचाउँदछन । वास्तवमा संस्कृतका पण्डितले जे जस्तो व्याख्या गरेता पनि खसको अर्थ मानवीय जात नै बुझिन्छ । मानवशास्त्रीले संसारमा थुप्रै मानवीय जात भएको बताए तापनि मोटामोटी रुपमा ककेसाइट जाति मंगोलाइट जाति र नेग्रोआइट जाति भनी ३ जातिको व्याख्या गरेका छन् । वैदिक सोचको विकास हुनुपूर्व ककेसाइट जातिका एक समूह काशगिरदेखि खसियापर्वतसम्म वस्दै आए त्यसजातिलाई खस भनिन्छ । नेपालको सन्दर्भमा १२ औं शताब्दितिर नागराजाले तिब्बतको खारी प्रदेशदेखि लिएर कुमाउ गढवालसम्मको भूभाग मिलाइ विशाल खस साम्राज्य स्थापना गर्दा त्यस भूभागमा बस्ने आदिवासीलाई खस भनिन्छ । 

खस क्षेत्री आदिवासी मात्रै हुन कि जनजाति पनि 

आदिवासी÷जनजाति सम्बन्धि हाम्रो संगठनले उठाएको सवाल सुचिकृतसँग सम्बन्धित छ । पहिलो कुरा त्यस्तो आदिवासी मात्र या जनजाति मात्र सुचिकृत हुने व्यवस्था नै छैन । दोस्रो कुरा आदिवासी÷जनजातिको सवाल दुई वेग्लै प्रकृतिको समाजको सवाल हैन । यसको अर्थ अंग्रेजीमा इन्डिजिनियस पिपलु हो । यसलाई संसारका अनेक वेग्लावेग्लै देशमा वेग्लावेग्लै शब्दले बुझिन्छ । किहं मात्र आदिवासी शब्दले त किहं जनजाति शब्दले त कतिपय देशमा मुलवासी ( First person) indigineous, hunter-gatherer, hill people, nomads, tribe, minoeroties, जस्ता थुप्रै शब्दले उही अर्थ बुझाउँछ । यस कुरालाई व्यवस्थित गर्ने हाम्रो ऐनको नाम आदिवासी÷जनजाति उत्थान राष्ट्रिय प्रतिष्ठान ऐन २०५८ रहेको छ । हामीले उक्त ऐनमा त्यसकै परिभाषा अन्तर्गत सुचिकृत हुने कुरा उठाएका छौं । 

हामी व्यक्तिलाई नागरिकताको प्रमाण पत्रको आवश्यक परे जस्तै हाम्रो समूहगत वैधानिक पहिचान अर्थात वैधानिक अस्तित्वका लागि सुचिकृत हुन माग गरेका हौं । यो समूहगत मानव अधिकार र जातीय विभेदको अन्त्यसँगै अधिकार स्थापनाको प्रश्न हो । तेस्रो कुरा जो सायद सबभन्दा महत्वपूर्ण छ त्यो हो आरक्षणको ग्यारेण्टीको व्यवस्थाको लागि । 
चौथो कुरा आइएलओक्षीइ नं।१६९ मा व्यक्त अग्राधिकार प्राप्तिका लागि । आइएलओ १६९ को धारा २१ ले व्यवसायिक तालिम धारा २४ ले सामाजिक सुरक्षा तथा स्वास्थ्य धारा २७३१ ले शिक्षा धारा ४ ७ १५ २० ३२ ले वातावरण सम्बन्धि संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघीय दृष्टिकोण तय गरेको छ । त्यस्तै कन्भेन्स नं। १०७ र १७३ ले जमिन एवं प्राकृतिक स्रोत साधनमाथिको पुस्तैनी अधिकारको हकलाई सुरक्षा प्रदान गरी परम्परागत पुर्खौली जग्गा जमिन तथा प्राकृतिक स्रोत साधनको उपयोग तथा परिचालनमाथि आदिवासी ÷जनजातिको अधिकारको ग्यारेण्टी गरेको छ । उक्त घोषणा नं। १६९ लाई हाम्रो सरकारले हस्ताक्षर र संसदले अनुमोदनसमेत गरिसकेको छ । यस्तो अवस्थामा माथि उल्लेखित अग्र अधिकारका लागि जो हाम्रा लागि नैसर्गिक रुपमा आवश्यक छन आदिवासी÷जनजातिमा सुचिकृत हुनुको विकल्प नै छैन । यस अभिसन्धीले राजनीति र नीति निर्माणमा आदिवासी जनजातिको समानुपातिक सहभागिता र अवसरमा पहुँचको व्यवस्था गर्दछ ।

यस अघिसम्म त खस भन्ने जाति नेपालमा छँदै छैन भनेर हामी नै जिद्धि गरेर िहंडिरहेका थियौं । हामीजस्ता सर्वसाधारण मानिस मात्रै कहाँ हो र हाम्रा थुप्रै खस दाजुभाइहरुले आफू सफल सम्पन्न र ठूला मानिस भएका बेला ठकुरी क्षेत्री बनेर बाँकी हामीजस्ता गरिब अशिक्षित मानिसहरुलाई आफन्तै भए पनि खसेको मतवाली भन्दै ुतल्ला जातुमा खसालेर राख्न त खस पावैु भन्ने अपमानजनक शब्द प्रयोग गर्दै आएका थिए । त्यसैकारणले हामीहरुलाई पनि आफू खस हौं भनेर स्वीकार गर्न धेरै लाज लाग्थ्यो । कसैले हामीलाई खस भनेमा रिसाउने र चित्त दुखाउने गर्दै आएका थियौं । त्यसो त आज पनि थुप्रै खसहरुलाई आफू खस हौं भनी स्वीकार गर्न लाज र असजिलो लाग्छ ।
दक्षिणा र दान लिनका लागि बाहुनहरुले हाम्रा पुर्खाहरुलाई फकाएर उनीहरुलाई मतवाली छेत्री भन्न सिकाएछन् । घरघरमा जाँडरक्सी बनाउने र कुखुराको मासु खाने भएकाले आफना सबै देवतालाई पनि जाँडरक्सी र कुखुराको मासु चढाउने चलन भएका हामी खसहरुलाई क्षेत्री शब्दले परिभाषित गर्न मिल्ने कुरा त थिएन । तर आफूले ठगिखान सजिलो हुने हुनाले हामीलाई क्षेत्री भनेर बाहुनहरुले फकाएछन् । यसो गरेर बाहुनले ठूलो गुन लाएको ठानेर हाम्रा सोझा लाटा पुर्खाले उनीहरुलाई दान दक्षिणा दिदै ढोग दर्शन गदै आएछन् । बाहुनले चाहि हामीजस्ता मतवालीका घरमा कर्मकाण्ड गर्न पस्यो भने आफू अपवित्र होइन्छ भनेर हाम्रो घरमा विवाह ब्रतबन्ध सुत्केरी न्वारान पास्नी हुँदा वा मर्दा र काजकिरिया गर्दा कुनै बेला पनि पुरेतको काम गर्न आउने गरेका छैनन् । तैपनि हामीचािहं हामीलाई झुक्याएर थांगनामा सुताउने ती बाहुनलाई आजसम्म गोडामा ढोग्ने र वर्षमा एकपल्ट उठ्ती उठाउन आएका बेला राडी फेरुवा देउ पाखी बाछी पाडी पाठा र खसीका साँप्रा आदि महंगा सामानको दान र नगद दक्षिणा दिने गरिआएकै छौं । हाम्रो मुख्य पेसा पशुपालन खेती भएको हुनाले बाहुनलाई दान दिने सबै सामान आफनो पसिना र परिश्रमद्वारा उत्पादित वस्तु हुन्छन् ।

बाहुन छेत्री ठकुरीबाट संधै तिरष्कृत हुँदै आएपनि आफूलाई छेत्री ठहराउने रहरमा हामीले आजसम्म जनजाति बन्न खोजेनौं । यसो गर्दा हामी घरका न घाटका भयौं । 
कोही कोही ज्यादै ठूलो ख्याति प्राप्त गरी शीर्षस्थ ओहोदामा पुगिसकेका नेपालका मूर्धन्य इतिहासकार त खस भन्ने शब्द सुन्दा मात्रै पनि रिसले रन्थनिने गर्थे भन्ने कुरो हामीले सुनेका छौं । खस भन्ने हुँदै नभएको कुरा हो भनेर जिद्धी गर्थे रे उनी । सायद उनले पनि अरु धेरै मानिसले जस्तै पहिलेका खसजति सबै ठकुरी छेत्री र खसका धामी जति सबै बाहुन बनिसके भन्ने ठानेका थिए होलान । तर यथार्थचाहि त्यस्तो छैन । हामी जस्ता दशौं लाख खस बाँकी नै छौं । हामी अझै छेत्री ठकुरी र बाहुन बनिसकेका छैनौ लेखकले खासगरी कर्णाली भेगमा बस्ने विशुद्ध खसका विषयमा कलम चलाउनु भएको छ ।सं। तैपनि खसका माथिल्ला तहका ठूलाठालूजतिलाई जनै लगाइदिने काम उहिले नै पूरा भइसक्यो भन्ने ठानेर होला केही उपकारी बाहुन पण्डितहरु पूर्वतिर लागेर राई लिम्बू सुनुवार र तामांगहरुलाई व्रतवन्ध गरेर जनै लगाइदिने काममा व्यस्त हुन थालेका छन रे भन्ने कुरा पनि हामीले सुनका छौं …।

युवराज कार्कीँ÷बुद्धिबहादुर राउतले खस विद्यार्थी आवाजमा खसका विषयमा यसरी लेख्नु भएको छ-

क खस समाजको मातृभाषाले आज नेपालको सरकारी कामकाजको राष्ट्रिय भाषाको मान्यता प्राप्त गरेको छ । पूर्वी पहाडी अर्थात सिाजालीबाट पर्वते गोर्खाली हुँदै नेपाली नामाकरण भएको र मध्य पहाडि अर्थात गढवाली भाषाको संयुक्त र मूल रुपलाई खस कुरा भनिन्थ्यो । आज नेपाली भाषाका रुपमा प्रचलित भाषा नै खस भाषा भएकाले खस क्षेत्रीको आफ्नै समृद्ध भाषा भएको प्रष्ट छ । 
ख खस क्षेत्री समाजको परम्परागत रितिरिवाज अनगिन्ति भएको उदाहरणसहित पेश गर्न सकिन्छ ।

It is considered as the heart of Kathmandu city. As it leads to the former Royal Palace of Narayanhiti, Durbar Marg is also known as King's way among foreigners. It is a famous tourist area after Thamel. Durbar Marg is a posh area of Kathmandu with luxury hotels, restaurants serving international cuisines, pricey boutiques, travel agencies and airline offices.

A statue of King Mahendra, father of King Birendra stands in the center of the roundabout at the junction of Durbarmarg with Jamal. The ancient settlement of Jamal was a victim of the Ranas' enthusiasm for building. The rulers seized land from farmers and monasteries, demolishing an old bahal to make way for the new road. The bahal, one time abode of the White (Sveta) Matsyendranath, stood where the god's image had been found in a field, an event commemorated every year at the Jana Baha Dyah Jatra. Sveta Matsyendranath's chariot is assembled and driven three times round the spot over which the statue of King Mahendra now presides. Also on Durbar Marg, the greater part of which was built during the Rana era, are the campus of Tri-Chandra College and a mosque used by the valley's Muslim minority.
Recently, the Royal Palace was turned into a public museum immediately after the country was declared a republic. Few years back there has been a recent upsurge in the construction activities in the region. Durbarmarg is a central junction for the road connecting Lazimpat and Thamel, Bhat-Bhateni and Baluwatar, New Road and Asan and Putali Sadak and Kamaladi. Durbar Marg is one of the most well maintained and cleanest places in the Kathmandu valley, and a green belt has been created in the side way. Narayanhity Palace Museum, luxury hotels, shopping malls, discos, pubs and famous branded showroom's have been a special feature of Durbar Marg.","""""","""""","""""","""""","""""","Landmark/Street/Shopping District",object,"""""",""""""

Dhaubhadel and Mrs. Ranjana Dhaubhadel founded the Siddhi Memorial Health Service Centre (SMHSC) on the 28th of October 1993 at Barahisthan, Bhaktapur Municipality-14. This non-governmental and non-profit clinic provided primary health care services to needy women and children under the guiding principle of “Service to Humanity”. Today there is an ongoing Saturday morning clinic held at the SMHSC, addressing the ever-increasing demand of Family Planning and Immunization in this region, as well as providing pre-natal and post-natal care and general checkups.

The growing demand of the centre encouraged the founders to expand its health services, and to establish a hospital for women and children. An initial commitment towards sponsorship was made by the founders in the form of a contribution of land. This totaled an area of 4000 square meters, located at the mid-southern periphery of Bhaktapur City at Bhimsensthan, Bhaktapur -7.

On the 1st January 1998, Siddhi Memorial Hospital (SMH) construction was opened. The Outpatient Department (OPD), providing OPD care for women and children.

In 2003 the Siddhi Memorial Foundation (SMF) was established, merging the SMHSC into the SMF. At this time the organization branched into public health with its first HIV/AIDS Harm Reduction Program. SMF now conducts two harm reduction programs funded by UNODC.

On the 22nd October 2005, we opened the Siddhi Shaligram Briddhashram (SSB). The mission of SSB is to help elderly people live peaceful, fulfilling and happy lives.

The government of Nepal is serious about this issue and thus has invested maximum effort and resources in order to develop new facilities to enhance the existing health services. Nepal has made a significant progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), particularly in the health sector.

An estimated figure shows that about 3000 people develop kidney failure every year in Nepal where as an incidence of liver failure is 1,000 every year. Similarly the estimated diabetic population who might be benefited from pancreas transplantation in Nepal is 30% of the 10 Lac diabetics. There is no data of heart or lung failure in the country yet.

The incidence of end stage renal disease (ESRD) is rising worldwide. It is an important cause of high mortality and morbidity and the treatment of ESRD is costly. More than 90% of ESRD population dies within few months in South Asia. Out of this 3000, only around 25-30% patients can reach the hospitals with dialysis facilities.

The estimated cost of haemodialysis is NRs. 8,322 ($ 114) / month in Bir hospital and NRs. 16644 ($228) / month in NGOs and private sectors. The cost of renal transplant is upto $ 25000 in India depending whereas it costs around NRs. 500000 ($7000) at Bir hospital.

At present, only a small number of Kidney failure patients have benefited from the kidney transplant programme in the country as large numbers of such patients are still going to neighboring India or other countries for various reasons. More importantly, the access of Nepali patients with liver failure, diabetes, heart or lung failure to the respective organ transplantation has been a big challenge and probably impossible for most of our people.

There is no facility for liver, pancreas, bone marrow, heart or lung transplantation in the country yet. So, to establish an ultramodern center for nephrology, urology, and kidney transplantation, hepato-biliary, pancreatic diseases and liver / pancreas transplantation, bone marrow and heart or lung transplantation at an affordable cost and to save millions of rupees that is drained out every year in the treatment of such organs in the neighboring countries. It will also avoid the harassment and hassle the patients and the family have to face during their stay in the foreign countries.

The government of Nepal decided to develop a modern “Human Organ Transplant Center HOTC”, on 12th Aswin, 2067 (28th Sept 2010) in the new building of Bhaktapur hospital to help its citizens with organ failures to sustain quality lives and improve their life expectancy with immediate availability of facilities for the treatment of kidney diseases including dialysis, urology, nephrology and transplantation.

The ministry of Health and Population (MOHP) under the leadership of Minister Uma Kanta Chowdhary and Secretary Prof. Dr, Praveen Mishra formed a high level committee with Prof. Dr. Vijay Kumar Sharma,NAMS, Bir hospital as chairman on 20th Poush, 2067 (4th January, 2011) to submit a study report to establish the center. Actual service come into operation in Falgun 2068 when Minister for Health and Population Mr. Rajendra Mahato and Health Secretary Dr. Praveen Mishra took the initiative to start the service without delay. The center  started Nephrology, Urology and Transplant OPDs from Falgun 7, 2068.","""""","Phase I : To establish‘National Institute of Nephrology, Urology and Kidney Transplantation along with upgrading of the existing Bhaktapur Hospital.

Phase II: To develop Liver, Pancreas and Bone marrow transplantation service and work on initiating Heart and Lung transplantation.
Phase I

Within one Year time:

The institute has achieved this goal as mentioned earlier.

Nephrology, Urology and Renal Transplant, Cardioogy OPD services: People from all over the country and particularly from Bhaktapur have benefitted from these services being provided by the specialist clinicians.

Haemodialysis services: 20 Haemodialysis machines are already functioning with other required accessory establishments such as Reverse Osmosis (RO) machine and automated Dialyser wash(Renatron) services. The center is determined to reduce the cost of haemodialysis providing the service with only Rs. 250 per session service charge. The center aims to double the capacity of haemodialysis machines in the current fiscal year and to initiate the peritoneal dialysis service at the same time.

Since its establishment, the center has been constantly working for the awareness and educational activities for prevention of kidney diseases, renal failure and promote organ donation – both live and ‘brain death’ for kidney and other organ transplantation in the country.

Goals to be achieved as targeted in one year time:

    Training of doctors, nurses and different manpower to start and strengthen the service for kidney patients in other hospitals across the country

    Research in the field of kidney related medical science, surgical conditions and their management aspects.

In three year time:

    Post graduate course to generate required human resources in the field of nephrology, urology and kidney transplantation

Both of them know how it feels to lose their father as a child. So for them it felt natural to help orphan children and they established the orphan home in Sipadol.

At the moment there are 20 children living in Bhaktapur orphan home. They have their own house. Beside children’s bedrooms there is a kitchen, two bathrooms (one in each floor), a playing and studying room, office and roof top terrace.

We want to be as self-sustaining as possible at the orphan home and step by step moving towards this goal. We grow our own vegetables (cabbage, potatoes, pumpkins, spinach, onions, chilies etc.) and it helps us to reduce our expenses for food a lot (we save about 450000 NPR (4000 EUR) per year). Part of land we own, part – we rent.

We also have one young female buffalo, which in the future will be providing milk for our children. In the same animal house we raise several goats and about 100 chickens.

Children also get involved in gardening and farming activities, because we believe this helps them to get skills which children usually get growing in families.

In 2012 we also started a goat farm about 1,5 hour drive from Sipadol. Now we have just 30 goats, but in the future we hope to increase this number and sell goat meat. This would help us to generate sustainable income.

Besides that, our children shower with hot water and we heat it in environmentally friendly way – with solar battery.

All our children attend a private English school (Gundu secondary school). After school, they also get help with their homework from a professional  teacher. Shakhar k.c. comes regularly to teach them.

Most of our children lost both of their parents. There are several who have fathers, but they don’t take care of them. Also there are 3 women looking after our children (cooking, cleaning etc.) and their children live together in our orphan home, because their fathers died.

In a future we would like to expand number of our children to 50. But for that we need more space – to build one more floor of the house.

We don’t get any financial support from any governmental institution of Nepal. Bhaktapur orphan home is supported by several good people and businesses from all over the world; also we are supported by organization “Hands with hands”. The rest – comes from Ryia’s and Rupak’s families and Rupak’s business, which he runs together with his business partner.","""""","Helping orphan kids for Education & how to get  independent life  for their future.","Bhaktapur self-Sustaining orphan home ,

Samata School - Kathmandu, Nepal


Despite its natural beauty, spirituality and rich culture, Nepal is one of the most economically poor countries in the world.
Around one and a half million people live in the bustling capital, with thousands more residing in the surrounding villages and mountain hamlets, where life is especially difficult.
Here, the majority of the population rely on subsistence farming or try to earn a living from tourism or weaving, but machine-made goods and poor harvests have significantly limited their prospects.
Consequently some families send their children to live with other families in the city, their household chores or factory work paying for bed and board.
Many such children attend Samata School in the centre of Kathmandu. Because of their domestic or factory labour duties there are usually only around half of the students – 1,500 – in school at any one time.
Lots of Samata's students are orphans or have been separated from their families during political upheaval; for them school is home and their only chance of gaining an education and social skills. Others rely on Samata to provide basic medical care and a meagre lunch, which usually amounts to just a handful of rice.
Founded and run by a young, visionary philanthropist, the present school was built from scratch when it had to be moved two years ago. There are now rudimentary bamboo-and-plaster classrooms, as well as very basic sanitation and kitchen facilities.
Although the school provides a safe and harmonious environment for the children, conditions are dark and cramped and the aim is to improve the site as more money becomes available.
Lessons at the school are conducted in English and concentrate on a thorough learning of the language, which is the most important education a Nepalese child can have. Without it they cannot take public exams or apply for a job in tourism or communications.
The school also pays special attention to the spiritual development of its pupils, giving a sound education of Nepal, the country's needs, the importance of honesty, peace and caring for others.
As such, many of the children have a desire to become doctors, nurses, social workers and teachers, so that they can make their own contribution to society and repay the debt they feel they owe for their education.

Uttam Sanjel

About Uttam Sanjel

Uttam Sanjel is a 35 year old man born in Nepal. When he was 25 years of age, he had gone to Mumbai India to make a successful career on Bollywood Film Industry; there he spent 3 years of his life struggling for success. When he was living in Mumbai, he happened to see something terrible about street children on the streets of Mumbai and train station platforms and realized that real heroes of our world are not famous movie stars but people like Mahatma Gandhi and Mother Teresa who perform great jobs for the welfare of society.

This realization inspired him to come back to Nepal and work for needy and poor children and came up with an idea with building Schools from Bamboo’s that has the lowest infrastructural costs. Bamboos are inexpensive; strong, earthquake proof and very easy to find as well. Use of bamboos lowers the construction cost by 60%. He calls his school as Samata Shiksha Niketan which means, “A place for study and peace”. Uttam Sanjel is a powerhouse of altruistic energy. He has no selfish regards regarding his works; he is very optimistic and devoted towards his work from his heart for the welfare of the society.
About His Work

Samata Shiksha Niketan

Samata Shiksha Niketan was established on 2001. It charges a fee of Rs 100 per month for all the grades from Nursery to Class 10. This fee has been in constant since its establishment. The School has now been expanded into 11 different locations within 8 districts of Nepal such as Kathmandu, Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, Kavre Palanchowk, Sindhu Palchowk, Chitwan, Nawalparasi, and Makwanpur. Last year only, 11 students from the first batch had appeared on the SLC Board Exam and all of them graduated with first division mark with a minimum of 75% and some of his graduates have gone to higher education. The school currently has 16000 students.

When Uttam Sanjel built his first school he had asked his neighboring families to donate at least one piece of bamboo each. In Nepal, girls are often considered inferior to boys and not worthy of an education but Uttam Sanjel denies the fact and not ready to accept it, so at the bamboo schools he builds, the enrollment is higher for girls than boys. His ultimate goal is to build 75 schools one in each district of Nepal.

In an interview, Uttam says that, “If I were married, I would have only a couple of children. I have 15,000. What could be better? “ Uttam’s motto is, “To rest is to rust” and what he tells to his students is that, “In some schools in the world, children are taught to become human bombs. Here I want you to become peace bombs in the village, in your family and in society”.

To know about Bhaktapur is to love Bhaktapur – a bubbling bustling melting pot of races and religious where Newars, Brahmin, Tamang and many other ethnic groups live together in peace and harmony. Our Multiculturalism has made Bhaktapur a Gastronomical paradise and home to hundreds of Spectacular temples and colourful festivals (It is also said that we have more temples than houses, more festivals than a days in a year and more god and goddesses than people). It’s wonder that we love  celebrating and socializing. As a people Bhaktapurians are very relaxed, warm and friendly.
Bhaktapur, the fabled city of gods; a Newars town at the eastern rim of the Kathmandu valley is a wonderful amalgam of religious and cultural attracitions. The city chowks, and lanes bespeak a vibrancy and energy that are impossible for anybody to miss. The sheer number of festivities, dances, songs and traditions, indigineous and unique to bhaktapur give it a distinct identity, one that is in many ways less influenced by the urbanization and modernity that have taken over must of Kathmandu and Patan.
Geographically, Bhaktapur is almost as diverseas its culture, 2 Municipalities and 16 VDC’s, 13 km east from the Capital city Kathmandu. Situated at altitude of 1401meters above sea level, with the area of 138 sq km and founded by Kind Ananda Dev In 889 A.D. Bhaktapur is said to have been in the shape of Conch, the sacred emblem of Lord Bishnu, literally, Bhaktapur refers the “the city of Devotees”.
One of Bhaktapur Key Attraction is its extreme contrasts which further add this theme of diversity: towering temples look down upon wooden houses built on stilts while tourist standards hotels sit just meters away from ancient reefs.
Rugged mountains reach dramatically for the sky while their rainforest –clad slopes, sweep down to flood plain teeming with forest life. Cool highland hideaways roll dosn to warm and rich humid mangroves. 

For the perfect holiday full of surprise, the time is now, the place is Bhaktapur.

","""""","""""","Bhaktapur—locally known by Khwopa—is world renowned for its elegant art, fabulous culture andindigenous lifestyle. For its majestic monuments, colorful festivals and the native Newars best known for their long history of craftsmanship, the ancient city is also variously known as the ""City of Culture"", the ""Living Heritage"" and ""Nepal’s Cultural Gem"". Given such unequaled opulence in ancient art and culture, Bhaktapur is more like an open museum, and the ambiance here is such that it instantly transports visitors back by centuries the moment they step into its territory.

Bhaktapur has its gem in the Durbar Square—a World Heritage site listed by the UNESCO. Strewn with unique palaces, temples and monasteries best admired for their exquisite artworks in wood, metal and stone, the palatial enclave has bewitched pilgrims and travelers for centuries. Yet, they are not all though. Adding to the mesmerizing environs is the holy Himalaya that makes the backdrop of the city. Stretching all along the township, the panoramic Himalaya levitates in the skyline as if to keep vigilance on the city’s enviable beauty and splendor.

Bhaktapur, at 1,401 meters above sea level, spreads over an area of 6.88 square kilometers. It grows from a collection of villages strung along the old trade route between India and Tibet. The capital city of the Greater Malla Kingdom till the 15th century AD, Bhaktapur was founded in the 12th century by King Ananda Malla, but it was only in the early 18th century that this city took its present shape. It was at that time that many of Bhaktapur’s greatest monuments were built by the then Malla rulers.

MONUMENTS

Monumental masterpieces in Bhaktapur are innumerable, and each is more attractive than the other. Mostly terra-cotta structures supported by carved wooden columns, elaborately carved struts, windows and doors, gilded roofs and pinnacles, open spacious courts all around and, above all, the fascinating divine images presiding over the monument—many edifices have many things in common, yet their varied shape, size and designs make the one even more wondrous than the other. Furthermore, each of their components reflects the religious belief, social outlook and the economic status of the builders, and the monuments in all carry along a rich artistic tradition of the native Newars.

In Bhaktapur, visitors confront a smaller or larger monument almost at every ten or twenty steps. Perhaps stunned by the clusters of monuments, a visitor in the past had admired the Kathmandu Valley, saying that ""every other building (in the Valley) is a temple and every other day a festival"". The proportion, owing to continual external invasions and natural calamities, might have changed over centuries, yet the presence of variously shaped and sized monuments in Bhaktapur is still awe-inspiring. The world-famous Nyataponla Temple, Bhairavnath Temple, Taleju Temple, 55-Window Palace, Golden Gate, Golden Faucet, Big Bell, Yaksheswor Mahadev Temple, Dattatreya Temple, Peacock Window, Taja Math, Pujari Math, Wakupati Narayan Temple, Nava Durga Temple, Chandeswori Temple, Barahi Temple, Bharbacho Gate, Terra-cotta Windows and Nepal’s largest Shiva Lingum at Hanumanghat, and such historic ponds as Ta-Pukhu, Na-Pukhu, Bhajya-Pukhu and Bahre-Pukhu (Kamal Pokhari) are simply a few among many that embellish the city’s brick- and stone-paved squares, courtyards and open fields. Besides, the presence of a great many Buddhist monuments, many of them rubbing shoulders with Hindu shrines, simply reaffirms the age-old Nepalese tradition of social harmony and religious tolerance among its peace-loving populace. Because of this time-tested tradition, Bhaktapur’s well known Lokeswor Mahavihar, Prasannasheel Mahavihar, Chatu Brahma Mahavihar, Jaya Kirti Mahavihar, Sukra-varna Mahavihar, Dipanker Mahavihar and many other Buddhist shrines have been the places of esteem and adoration for the Hindus alike.

CULTURE & FESTIVALS

The cultural traditions of Bhaktapur are no less glorious than its artistic masterpieces. The ancient ritual dances and festivals here are observed with the same fervor and enthusiasm as they were centuries ago. Consequently, the city is still a venue for a great many festivals and cultural dances, many of them as unique as the city itself. While Bhaktapur’s Gai-Jatra (July/August) and the tantrically-inspired Nava Durga Dance (October-June), which is comprised of the city’s protectress deities, are the ""only ones of their kinds"" in Nepal, the Biska Jatra (April), one of Nepal’s greatest and most exciting festivals, is the only such event observed according to the official solar calendar.

HANDICRAFTS

Besides the physical monuments and cultural festivities, the Newars of Bhaktapur have also inherited a long history of craftsmanship. It is here where visitors can have rare close-up views of Nepal’s master craftsmen giving continuity to their time-honored traditions of art. In its two famed Pottery Squares, they can see potters giving shape to lumps of clay on their traditional wooden wheels. Besides, they also encounter the city’s well-acclaimed artisans who, with their wondrously skilled hands, produce a great variety of handicrafts. Bhaktapur’s indigenous handicraft varieties include paubha scroll paintings, papier-mâché masks, cotton cloth, woodcarvings, metalwork, jewelry and ceramic products. In addition, the home-spun haku-patasi (black sari), black cap and the delicious Juju-dhau, literally the ""King of all yogurt varieties"", have also made this city a favored spot for tourists and the Nepalese alike.

PRESERVATION EFFORTS

For Bhaktapur and its tradition-loving locals, having monuments and culture alone is not all. For them, preservation of the mankind’s shared glories is as much important as the creation of new ones. Keeping this in mind, Bhaktapur Municipality has launched an ambitious campaign for the purpose. In this course, the local body so far has carried out massive restoration of the Nyataponla and Bhairavnath temples, Ta-Pukhu (Siddha Pokhari), the Bhandarkhal Complex, and many other monuments of both religious and archeological importance. Now on the anvil of the municipality are the undertakings involving the rehabilitation of the Taleju Temple Complex, Chatu Brahma Mahavihar, Yaksheswor Mahadev Temple and the 55-Window Palace. In addition, the upkeep of the streets and squares will continue as it had in the past. The most notable part of all these conservation efforts is the active participation of the locals as well as the visiting tourists. While the locals on their part contribute with their labor and skills, tourists do the same through their moral and monetary support.

Bhaktapur Municipality’s commitment to the preservation and promotion of the city and its glorious traditions of art and culture also has taken shape into the legendary Bhaktapur Festival 1997. Organized by the local body for five consecutive days, from October 22 to 26, 1997, the mega event—the first and biggest of its kind ever held in Nepal—had been instrumental in promoting not only Bhaktapur, but also the whole nation in the international arena.

Effortful of realizing its noble objectives, Bhaktapur Municipality has also enforced a ban on vehicles in the Durbar Square. Effective since 1992, the law forbids heavy vehicles from getting into the city core and all kinds of automobiles into the palatial enclave. Because of the municipality’s endeavors and cooperation from the local citizens, Bhaktapur today is Nepal’s one of the least polluted urban areas, besides being the country’s best preserved city.

Given the historic city’s artistic and cultural riches combined with the unspoilt natural atmosphere all around it, a visit to Bhaktapur will sure to become an experience of a lifetime for many. A quiet stroll down the city’s tranquil streets not only take them into a drastically different socio-cultural environment, but also help them explore a glorious dimension of human civilization that is Bhaktapur.

DURBAR SQUARE

Bhaktapur’s Durbar Square is the gem not only of Bhaktapur, but also of the entire nation. The most fascinating structure here is the world-renowned 55-Window Palace. The elaborately carved windows and doors are something that visitors simply cannot help admiring. The seat of royalty before 1769 AD, the building now houses the National Art Gallery—the museum better known for its rich collection of paubha scroll paintings and breathtaking artworks in stone.

The world famous Golden Gate rubs shoulders with the 55-Window Palace. An unparalleled specimen of repousse art dating back to 1756 , it is the entrance to the marvelous Taleju Temple Complex. Getting into it leads to a number of artistica-lly designed chowks (courtyards) including the Royal Bath, which is adorned with the well-admired Golden Faucet among others.

Another artwork that unfailing-ly bewitches visitors in the Square is the Big Bell. Big enough to match its name, the bell was erected by Ranajit Malla (r. 1722-1769), Bhaktapur’s last Malla king. It was used in those days for paying homage to Goddess Taleju, the lineage deity of Malla rulers, as well as to call assemblies of the citizens to discuss on given subjects concerning the state. Today, it is rung twice a day as a mark of tribute to the goddess. Right next to it is a smaller Barking Bell. To one’s surprise, all dogs around it start whining the moment it is rung by its caretaker.

The Yaksheswor Mahadev Temple equally adds to the Square’s unparallaled beauty. Named after its builder king, Yaksha Malla (r. 1428-82), the two-storied pagoda was constructed after Kathmandu’s world famous Pashupatinath temple. It is noted for its wooden struts full of erotic carvings.

Other notable monuments in and around the historic Durbar Square are: the octagonal Chyasin Mandap, Siddhi Laxmi Temple, Shiva Temple (Fasi-dega), Vatsala Temple, Bhandarkhal Complex, Chatu Brahma Mahavihar, Indrayani Temple, Balakhu Ganesh Temple, Tripura-sundari Temple and the Char Dham symbolizing the four greatest Hindu pilgrimage sites.

TAUMADHI SQUARE

The Nyataponla Temple presides over the Taumadhi Square. Dating back to 1702 AD, the colossal five-storied edifice is the country’s tallest pagoda temple. The struts, doors, windows and tympanums—each embellished with attractively carved divine figures—perfectly portray the creative tradition of Newar craftsmen. The temple is dedicated to Goddess Siddhi Laxmi, the manifestation of female force and creativity. The latest major renovation of this monument was carried out in 1997 AD by Bhaktapur Municipality using the revenue it collected from tourists.

Next to the Nyataponla Temple is the rectangular shaped Bhairavnath Temple. It houses a gilded bust of Bhairav, the ferocious manifestation of Lord Shiva. The three-storied pagoda was razed to the grounds by the 1934-earthquake, and its latest renovation was undertaken by Bhaktapur Municipality in 1995 AD.

The enclosed complex facing the Nyataponla Temple is dedicated to Tilmadhav Narayan, a manifestation of Lord Vishnu, who is one of the Supreme Triumvirate of Hindu pantheon. A few steps ahead it, to the southwest, lies the famous Pottery Square, where visitors can see the city’s well-known potters making variously shaped and sized earthenware. The major monumental highlight of this square is a temple of Jeth Ganesh, which dates back to the 14th century.

DATTATREYA SQUARE

The Dattatreya Square is Bhaktapur’s third dazzling gem. The seat of royalty till the 15th century, the area still houses a great number of historic monuments including many wondrous Maths (residential mansions) and temples.

The Dattatreya Temple is the main attraction of the Square. Constructed by King Yaksha Malla, the giant three-storied temple is believed to have been built with the stem of a single tree. Having defied series of calamities, it still bears testimony to the incredible achievement made in those regal days of the Nepalese history.

The Wane Layaku complex, which lies to the south-western corner of the Dattatreya temple, is noted for Bhaktapur’s second Taleju shrine. Enclosed with old houses, the courtyard sees throngs of people, especially during the Mohani (Dashain) festival, when a rare Ghau-batacha (Water Clock) is put on public display. During the Malla Era, the water-clock was used by the then rulers and astrologers for fixing ""propitious moments"" for commencing and concluding various state and social ceremonies.

The Peacock Window, which is also called the ""Mona Lisa of Nepal"", is a rare masterpiece in wood. Dating back to the early 15th century, the unique latticed window has an intricately carved peacock in its center. The window adorns the Pujari Math which, with rows of exquisitely carved windows and doors, is equally appealing. The building presently houses the Woodcarving Museum. The museum has a rich collection of unique pieces in wood.

The Brass & Bronze Museum, housed in the historic Chikanpha Math, is the next highlight of the Square. It has a wide collection of bronze and brasswares including the ritual jars, utensils, water vessels, pots, spittoons and similar other household items.

Near the Dattatreya Square is the Wakupati Narayan Temple. Dedicated to Lord Vishnu, the two-storied structure is a unique specimen of pagoda architecture. Next to it is Bhaktapur’s second Pottery Square.

Besides Bhaktapur’s three well-acclaimed Squares, there are many other spots within the expanse where visitors can experience a lot more. The recently-restored Ta-Pukhu (Siddha Pokhari), Ancha-Pukhu, Khancha-Pukhu, Barahi Temple, Lokeswor Mahavihar, Nava Durga Temple, the Terra-cotta Windows at Tuchhimala and Nepal’s largest Shiva Lingum at Hanumanghat are some of Bhaktapur’s monumental glories which tourists visiting this ancient city simply do not like to miss","""""",object,Company,object,"""""",""""""

However, at present it is running as an independent organization.
The methodology will be based on similar systems as that exists in German speaking countries, whereas the content will be filled with data directly from Nepal. Therefore, the list of professions available in Nepal, list of educational paths as well as cultural specific aspects (i.e. societal boundaries) will be considered.
Scientific test will be provided online as well as in offline version, which shall guide students to choose a right education and future profession. 
The second and free product of Career Disha  Nepal will provide a comprehensive online database, which will give detailed information on the jobs and professions. It can be accessed via a link from the analysis as well as independently through a search result. In general the aim of this part is to make career planning related information more transparent and accessible. All possible professions will be listed and closely described, including the demand in the labour market, what kind of organization employs somebody from this field as well as the possible educational paths and institutes. 
A third product is planned already but is not  a part of the initial project. An Ability Based Test will be built in the second phase upon the first test and will create a rough ability profile (assessment through quizzes and self assessment). With this the student is able to identify the jobs where s/he brings the right skills (technical understanding, capability of conflict management, rhetoric skills …).
Beside these main technical products, we will develop supportive services over time like guidelines on how to use the tests for counselling sessions; seminars for counsellors or other career counselling related material that provide a holistic service in this area.

Career Disha will run as a Social Business, with the aim to be self sustaining on the long run. As we expect high initial costs the strategy would be to use grants and subsidies for the initial costs additional to the investment of the local partners. 
","""""","VISION AND IMPACT:

The problem we want to solve:
Unemployment and youth unemployment is a big issue in Nepal. On the one hand organizations are always in search for persons with the right qualification and keeping them on the long run, many organizations face a high fluctuation. Young employees only realize during their first work experiences (normally after their Bachelor or Master) if they really fit into their profession. 
On the other hand there are many young people struggling through the various kinds of education (+2 in management, Bachelor in IT, Master in English) and end up not fitting into the available jobs in the market. 
Many young people lack awareness about the variety of possible professions and choose thereby rather an educational path to a profession with higher prestige than one fitting to their competencies. 

Our Vision
Creating understanding to parents, teachers and students in Nepal about career counselling and have understanding on student’s personality, ability and interest which plays a crucial role in finding a suitable job and a pathway regarding Education in future. 

Positive Social Impact:
Choosing an educational path based on career counselling should create a higher degree of harmonization between job-seeking youth and the need for qualified staff in the private as well as in the third sector. 
As this impact is only to be measured on a long run and may also depend upon several other factors (development of the specific field of education, development of the labour market, societal boundaries for certain groups on specific jobs ….), we would also define the social impact on a smaller scale in reducing the lack of orientation of the individual student with regard to the best choice of education. 
Also economical benefit will occur in two different ways. Firstly, families will be shown alternative professions for their children. In many cases this alternative options might be cheaper as there is not such a high demand for the not so popular educations and therefore it is to assume that the fees would be less. 
Another benefit will be an indirect one, also hard to measure. By choosing the career path, youth and later young adults will have higher possibilities in the job market. When they after their education join the labour market in a field where there is a high demand for skilled persons rather than over saturated fields like Management their placement ability and thereby the time of unemployment or underemployment falls.

I believe that God put us in this jolly world to be happy and enjoy life. Happiness does not come from being rich, nor merely being successful in your career, nor by self-indulgence. One step towards happiness is to make yourself healthy and strong while you are a boy, so that you can be useful and so you can enjoy life when you are a man. Nature study will show you how full of beautiful and wonderful things God has made the world for you to enjoy. Be contented with what you have got and make the best of it. Look on the bright side of things instead of the gloomy one. But the real way to get happiness is by giving out happiness to other people. Try and leave this world a little better than you found it and when your turn comes to die, you can die happy in feeling that at any rate you have not wasted your time but have done your best. 'Be Prepared' in this way, to live happy and to die happy — stick to your Scout Promise always — even after you have ceased to be a boy — and God help you to do it.

Established in 1972, IOE is Nepal's oldest and the widest engineering education consortium. IOE provides Diploma, Bachelors, Masters and Ph.D. degrees in engineering and architecture education through its constituent campuses and several private colleges affiliated to it.

History of engineering education in Nepal can be traced since 1930, when Technical Training School was established. Engineering section of the school offered only trades and civil sub-overseers programs. In 1959, Nepal Engineering Institute, with the assistance of the government of India, started offering civil overseer courses leading to Diploma in Civil Engineering. The Technical Training Institute established in 1965, with the assistance from the Government of Federal Republic of Germany, offered technician courses in General courses in General Mechanics, Auto Mechanics, Electrical Engineering and Mechanical Drafting.
In 1972, the Nepal Engineering Institute at Pulchowk and the Technical Training Institute at Thapathali were brought together under the umbrella of the Tribhuvan University to constitute the Institute of Engineering and the Nepal Engineering Institute and the Technical Training Institute were renamed as Pulchowk campus and Thapathali Campus respectively.
Since then, the Institute of Engineering has expanded considerably. The technician programs in Electrical, Electronics, Refrigeration/Air-conditioning Engineering were started in the Pulchowk campus, with the assistance from UNDP/ILO. The Architecture Technician program was started by the IOE in its own effort. With the assistance of the World Bank and UK, later, the existing technician level courses were strengthened and Bachelor's Degree level course in Civil Engineering was started.Similarly, with the assistance of the World Bank, the Swiss Government, and the Canadian Government, Bachelor Degree level courses in the Electronics, Electrical, Mechanical engineering and Architecture were started in the Pulchowk campus. From academic year 1998/99 IOE has started Bachelor's Degree program in Computer Engineering. In 1996, Pulchowk campus, with support from the Norwegian Government, has started M.Sc. Courses in Urban Planning, Structural Engineering, Environmental Engineering and Water Resources Engineering Pulchowk Campus has also started M.Sc. courses in Renewable energy and Geothermal Engineering, Information and communication and Power systems Engineering effective from December, 2001. The diploma level programs at the Pulchowk Campus have been transferred to other three IOE campuses.
The Thapathali Campus is presently offering three-year Diploma level courses in Mechanical, Automobile, Electronics, Civil Engineering and Architecture.
The Eastern Region Campus in Dharan, which began operating from 1984, was built with the financial assistance from Asian Development Bank and the technical assistance from the UK. This campus initially offered courses at the trade and technician levels. Now, it is offering Diploma level courses in the Civil, Electrical, Mechanical and Refrigeration/Air-conditioning Engineering. From academic year 2000/2001 Bachelor's Degree program in Agricultural Engineering has been started.
The Western Region Campus in Pokhara of IOE became operational from 1987, with the assistance from the World Bank and UNDP/ILO. Initially various trades and technician courses were offered at this campus. At present, it is offering Diploma level courses in the Civil, Electrical, Electronics, Automobile and Mechanical Engineering. From academic year 1999/2000 Bachelor's Degree program in Civil Engineering has been started.

When you move towards the core of this city, it would seem like a living museum because of its exquisite art and culture, its ancient monuments, shrines and temples, and because of the people who create them. This home of craftsmen is situated nearly 5 kilometers south of Kathmandu. A large part of Nepalese handicrafts is exported and about 90% of these handicrafts are manufactured in Patan. If you are an importer of handicrafts from Nepal or a souvenir buyer, you must at least visit Patan once while in Nepal. The most popular place in Patan for artists is Kanibahal, where Hotel Goodwill is located. When you step out of the hotel, you could observe the skillful artists working to produce different handicraft goods. Patan holds many cultural festivities in every average 15 days. One of them, which can be viewed from the hotel premises at the end of July is Mataya, a popular which is celebrated with long processions of devotees worshipping holy Buddhist stupas inside courtyards in Patan carrying lighted tapers. To celebrate all these, the hotel itself is decorated with lots of huge traditional style handmade statues, stone stupa, stone water taps, wood carvings, red brick (Dachi Appa) antique pillars etc. Every corner of the hotel has some type of Nepali art on the display. The hotel rooms are also named after the names of gods and goddesses. 

Thus, Hotel Goodwill offers hospitality as well as a glimpse into the fertile land of Nepali art and culture. Remember the hotel if you are interested in Nepali art, or if you are an importer of handicrafts from Nepal. You will not be disappointed.

We are on the ground in 166 countries, working with them on their own solutions to global and national development challenges. As they develop local capacity, they draw on the people of UNDP and our wide range of partners.

UNDP has been supporting the Nepalese people in their struggle against poverty since it opened an in-country office in 1963. Much of this support has gone to building up the capacity of government agencies, civil society and community groups to fight poverty, and to bringing these groups and Nepal's donors together to design and implement successful poverty alleviation projects.

UNDP in Nepal concentrates its efforts for greater impact in the most remote, poor, and/or conflict-affected areas of the mid- and far-western development regions and the Terai, where its rights-based interventions are targeted towards the disadvantaged and vulnerable groups. The UNDP programmes seek opportunities for joint programming with other United Nations organizations and engage in joint planning and monitoring of development activities in selected districts.

Currently the overarching priority of our work in Nepal is to help the Government and its people build a lasting peace and achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by:
•	Strengthening governance institutions from community to national Government levels;
•	Improving incomes and generating employment;
•	Improving the policy environment and planning capabilities;
•	Protecting Nepal's development gains from the ill-effects of natural disasters, climate change and HIV; and
•	Empowering women and disadvantaged people and fostering policies for equity and equality.

Within this framework, our Programmes address six priority areas for Nepal's development:
•	Transitional Governance 
•	Inclusive Growth & Sustainable Livelihood
•	Peace Building and Recovery 
•	Energy, Environment and Natural Disaster Management
•	HIV 

UNDP's activities span almost 75 districts and 1,000 out of 4,000 villages. The number of projects ongoing in 2011 is 29. Of the $30.5 million spent in 2011, almost $22m came from UNDP sources and bilateral/multilateral agencies. The main donor partner were DFID and Norway, Global Fund and DANIDA which funded 23% of programme expenditure.

Our offshore development services are focused at small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) offering end-to-end software development services on competitive terms.

For every project, we have a dedicated Technical Project Manager who liaises with the Client Technical Project Manager. The details of the project and requirements are discussed in detail. The Technical Project Manager then conveys these to the Team Lead who is based offshore. They formulate a high level Architecture document and analyze and design the application. The Client Technical Project Manager is kept updated on these developments and approves the developments. After this, the Team Lead briefs the Development team. The project then proceeds methodically, supported at every step by intensive documentation and strict adherence to specified guidelines. Every step of the development process is vetted by the Quality Analysis Team. The Quality Analysis Team and the Development Team interact on a continuous basis at every stage.

CARE is a leading humanitarian organization fighting global poverty. CARE places special focus on working alongside poor women because, equipped with the proper resources, women have the power to help whole families and entire communities escape poverty. Women are at the heart of CARE’s community-based efforts to improve basic education, prevent the spread of disease, increase access to clean water and sanitation, expand economic opportunity and protect natural resources. CARE also delivers emergency aid to survivors of war and natural disasters, and help people rebuild their lives.

In the fiscal year 2013, CARE worked in 87 countries around the world, supporting 927 poverty-fighting development and humanitarian aid projects to reach more than 97 million people.

CARE Nepal
CARE has been working in Nepal since 1978. Its initial focus was on addressing the basic needs of the poor and vulnerable communities through infrastructure development, agriculture extension activities and natural resource management. This focus changed in the 1990s with the introduction of a more diversified portfolio and a community-based ‘human infrastructure development’ approach. Since 2000, CARE Nepal has been working in partnership with local NGOs, networks, federations and community groups to address the underlying causes of poverty, conflict and vulnerability through promotion of gender and social inclusion, a rights-based approach and social mobilisation.

In 2013, CARE Nepal implemented 19 community development projects in 48 districts in partnership with over 50 NGOs and hundreds of community groups. CARE Nepal currently works in the following areas:

•	Climate Change and Natural Resource Management
•	Disaster Risk Reduction and Emergency Response
•	Food Security
•	HIV and AIDS
•	Maternal/Child/Family Health Services
•	Formal and Popular/Informal Education
•	Rural Infrastructure/Quick Impact Programme
•	Peace Building
•	Psychosocial Wellbeing of Women
•	Rural Micro-Financing
•	Water and Sanitation
•	Economic Opportunities
•	Advocacy and policy engagement
•	Strengthening the Civil Society

Gender equity and diversity, social inclusion and governance remain as cross cutting strategies through all of CARE Nepal’s work.

CARE Nepal identifies three primary focus areas for its current programmes:

a. Women’s Empowerment: Women’s empowerment has been one of the most significant focus areas. CARE Nepal looks into the economic, social, political, and cultural aspects of women’s lives, identify the challenges and carry out programs to mitigate them and support women. It has also been tracking achievements resulting from its intervention, for example, regarding the change in women’s access to resources and change in their decision making abilities.

b. Natural Resource Management/Environment/Securing Livelihoods: CARE Nepal seeks to enhance the access of PVSE communities including Dalits, the landless, women and those frequently affected by natural disasters and environmental degradation to natural resources along with improving their access to basic services such as health, education and economic opportunities.

c. Addressing Issues of Equity and Justice: CARE Nepal engages communities on issues of inequity and justice, challenges harmful traditional beliefs and aids in raising awareness. Policy dialogue and advocacy is also an integral part of this focus area.  

In order to deliver relevant and lasting development results in Nepal, CARE Nepal has been designing and implementing its programmes based on the findings from its Underlying Causes of Poverty Analyses (UCPA). In the rapidly changing socio-political context of Nepal, CARE Nepal has demonstrated its capacity to adapt and consistently focus its programmes on ensuring that the rights of the PVSE population are understood, respected and addressed in positive ways. CARE’s focus in Nepal and globally is to empower women and those who systematically face discrimination due to gender, caste, class, ethnicity and geographic settlement status.

CARE Nepal has collaborated with organizations including the National Forum for Women Rights Concern (NFOWRC), Federation of Community Forest User Groups (FECOFUN), Dalit NGO Federation (DNF), Nepal Federation of Indigenous Nationalities (NEFIN), National Association of People Living with HIV & AIDS (PLHA) Networks (NAP+N) and Disaster Preparedness Network (DP-Net) in order to amplify people’s voice in policy dialogue. 

At the district and community level, CARE Nepal has worked with local NGOs, district chapters of national networks and district line agencies. In 2013, CARE implemented 21 projects and initiatives in 48 districts in collaboration with over 50 partner NGOs and hundreds of community groups.

CARE Nepal is also member of the Association of International NGOs (AIN), an informal network of International NGOs operating in Nepal. It has also been involved in networks to prevent Sexual and Gender Based Violence (SGBV) against women and implementing United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1325.

As Gotama Rahugana composed many hymns in the Rgveda, these events must date to the Rgvedic period.The most important historical reference to Janakpur is in the Hindu epic Ramayana, where Lord Rama's wife Sita Devi is said to have been the Nepali princess of Videha. Her father, King Janak of Videha, found baby Sita in a furrow of a field in visit to Siraha and raised her as his daughter. When she grew up, the king announced that she should be wed by whoever was able to string the divine bow of Shiva. Though many royal suitors tried, Lord Rama, Indian prince of Ayodhya, alone could even lift the bow. As Rama and Sita are major figures in Hinduism, Janakpur is an important Nepalese pilgrimage site for Hindus all over the world.","""""","""""","""""","""""","""""",City,"""""","""""",""""""

At the beginning, it started as a fifteen bedded hospital in a rented building at Ramanand chowk of Janakpurdham.

It is located at 27°19'0N 86°30'0E and has an altitude of 1561 m (5124 ft).  The district gets its name from Okhal, meaning a grinding stone. As if in evidence of the same, a big grinding stone still lies at the district headquarters, which is also named as Okhaldhuga. The district contains ancient forts such as Okhaldhunga Gadhi, Taluwagadhi, Chisankhukot, Bhaluithumkagadhi, and Chyanmakotgadhi that were important in :the history of Nepal. The birthplace of the famous Nepalese poet, Siddhicharan Shrestha, Okhaldhunga is also known as the 'District of Martyrs'. It is believed that more than 56 citizens of the area died in the Nepalese struggle for democracy. The district provides scenic views of snow-capped mountains Sagaramatha, Kanchenjanga, Gaurishankar, Tholedemba, Taklung, Rawadelu and many others. It also possesses many sparkling springs like Pokali, Lipu, Patle, Sepli, Dhikure and more, which descend along the hills from heights of around 300 metres. The district is known. as a good source of slate, especially on the cliffs like Khiji Khijee, Ragani and Dandapakha. The proper development of the slate industry, with procurement, processing and transporting to.lucrative markets could be a boon not just for Okhaldhunga but the entire nation. Other industries that could be developed are copper mining and iron ore mining as the district is said to be rich in these metals. In the agricultural sector the district is well known for various cash crops such as like tea, coffee, cardamom etc. The climate is most suitable for these crops as well as for many different citrus fruits.","""""","""""","""""","""""","""""",City,"""""","""""",""""""

The Education: 
Education is light of life. In Khijee Chandeswory Village Development Committee, there is no even a university. After the completion of lower secondary and hight secondary education the students need to walk at least 90 minutes to reach the 10+2 which are situated in other Villages. There are very few students who have the luck to see the college and university. They can be count on fingers.  
All the above mentioned truths are the true-story of Khijee Chandeswory School. In this context, we would like to offer our honesty, simplicity and dignity to your corporation so that we can get some help in development of our village. 

Your little contribution can change our lives.

With an area of and a population of approximately 27 million, Nepal is the world's 93rd largest country by land mass and the 41st most populous country. It is located in the Himalayas and bordered to the north by the People's Republic of China, and to the south, east, and west by the Republic of India. Nepal is separated from Bangladesh by the narrow Indian Siliguri Corridor and from Bhutan by the Indian state of Sikkim. Kathmandu is the nation's capital and largest metropolis.The mountainous north of Nepal has eight of the world's ten tallest mountains, including the highest point on Earth, Mount Everest, called Sagarmāthā (सगरमाथा) in the Nepali language. More than 240 peaks over above sea level are located in Nepal. The southern Terai region is fertile and humid.Hinduism is practiced by about 81.3% of Nepalis, the highest percentage of any country. Buddhism is linked historically with Nepal and is practiced by 9% of its people, followed by Islam at 4.4%, Kiratism 3.1%, Christianity 1.4%, and animism 0.4%. A large portion of the population, especially in the hill region, may identify themselves as both Hindu and Buddhist, which can be attributed to the syncretic nature of both faiths in Nepal.","""""","""""","""""","""""","""""",Country,"""""","""""",""""""

Popularly known as Shakhada Bhagwati, because of its location, it is one of the famous Hindu shrines. There are many stories behind the existence of the goddess and the temple. However, most of the people believe that the idol of the goddess was found while digging the area for construction. Since then, the idol was restored there and worshipped. She was named Chinnamasta Bhagwati because her head was severed when her idol was found. The head was later replaced by gold mask. However, most of the time, a silver mask is put over her body.

The temple is one of the major religious heritages of the country that observes maximum number of national and international pilgrims. Hindu devotees from around the world come to worship the goddess and ask for her blessings. During the last three days of Navaratri (nine days before Dashain), the temple witnesses the massive sacrifice of goats and lambs. Even then, not a single fly is found in the area which is believed to be by the power of the goddess. The goddess is believed to grant the wishes of her devotees and those who have their prayers heard, often come back to take her blessings and make offerings.
 The area around the temple is quite and very clean as well. The wide area houses a Shiva temple, Hanuman statue, Ganesh temple, a wide pond, houses for performing pujas and yagyas. The devotees are to clean themselves in the pond before they enter the temple. Also the water from the pond is offered to the Devi.

One can easily get to the temple by boarding a bus or tempo. Other attraction of the place is the picnic spot that lies on the other side of the pond.  Also, on the way to Shakhada are two other temples, namely, Bagheswori and Dibarsthan, Dibarsthan being the main deity of the Kharshal Tol of Rajbiraj.","""""","""""","""""","""""","""""","Religious Organization","""""","""""",""""""

प्रज्ञा अभियान किन ? सबलाई सद्ज्ञान दिन ।
	अहिले हाम्रो समाजमा धेरै संस्कारहरु लोप भइसकेको कुनै लोपोन्मुख अवस्थामा पुगेको र केही प्रचलनमा रहे पनि प्राणहीन कर्मकाण्डका साथमा गरिने हुँदा संस्कार हुने ब्यक्तिले त्यो संस्कारको प्रेरणा,भावना,त्यसको वैज्ञानिक मनोवैज्ञानिक कारणको बारेमा थाहै पाइदैन । पंडित आफ्नै  धुनमा हुन्छन् संस्कार हुने यजमान हेल्लो हेलो भन्दै मोबाइलमा ब्यस्त हुन्छन, आफुलाई  त्यहाँ बिनाकाममा भुल्याएको ठान्छ , छिट्टै उठेर अरुसंग होहल्लामा सामेल हुन चाहन्छ । म जीवनको कुन मोडमा आइ पुगें? अब कसरी अगाडि बढ्नु पर्छ र मलाई यो प्रशिक्षण किन दिइदैछ भन्ने बुझेकै हुन्न । विवाहको भोलि पल्ट सोध्ने हो भने सप्तपदीको मर्म के हो ? प्रायश्चित्तको भावना के हो ? वर बधुको प्रतिज्ञाले के सिकायो ? थाहै हुन्न ।
	आजकल संस्कार खान–पान नाच–गान र शानमा सीमित भयो । जनै भिराई दिए पछि ब्रतबन्ध भयो । सिन्दुर खन्याइदिए  पछि बिवाह भयो । टीको र जवँरा लायो , नखाने कुरा खायो दशैं भयो । भैलो खेल्यो फागु खेल्यो, लोक संस्कृतिको जगेर्ना गरेको फूर्ति लायो । प्रत्येक चाड पर्बले दिन खोजको सन्देश प्रेरणा भावना वैज्ञानिक मनोवैज्ञानिक पक्ष त्यसको महत्व र आवश्कता बुझ्न नपाएर आज मनुष्यले आफैलाई हरायो । मनुष्यता गुमायो । मान्छे जस्तै देखिए पनि मान्छे हो कि होइन भनेर ठम्याउन पर्ने भयो । मान्छेले खान हुने र नहुने छुट्याउन छोड्यो , छिप्कली सम्म नछोड्ने भयो । संस्कार बिहिन भएर यस्तो भएको हो । “मानव जीवनको प्राण हो संस्कार”  भन्ने कुरा भुल्यो । जीवनभर कुकृत्यमा रमायो , मर्नेबेलामा  बृद्धाश्रमको हावा खायो । संस्कार छोड्दा के हुँदो रहेछ भन्ने अन्त्यमा बल्ल चाल पायो ।
 पाश्चात्य छाडा संस्कृतिको नक्कल गर्न खोज्दा खोज्दै आफ्नो अक्कल पुरै गुमाएर उच्छृंखल,उद्दण्ड,अशोभनीय र अब्यवस्थित जीवन जीउन पुगेकाहरुको सद्बुद्धि जगाएर मनुष्यमा देवत्व भर्न र समाजलाई सुसंस्कृत बनाउन सज्जनहरुलाई संगठित गरेर सत्साहस र सत्प्रवृति संबर्धन गरेर ंिसगों नेपाललाई नै प्रज्ञामय बनाउने कार्यक्रमको नाम हो “प्रज्ञा अभियान नेपाल” यसको मूल नारा हो ः–
             मेचि महाकाली चलाऊँ प्रज्ञा अभियान ।
	           सज्जनहरुको संगठन सत्प्रवृति संबर्धन ।।
अहिले पनि समाजमा सज्जनहरुको संख्या कम छैन, सज्जनहरु संगठित नभएको मौका पारी दुर्जनहरुले दुष्प्रबृति फैलाउन सफल भएका हुन् । यदि सज्जनहरु संगठित हुने हो भने समाजमा सत्प्रबृति फैलाउन सकिन्छ भन्ने सोचका साथ पहिलो पटक 
                 	    “वैज्ञानिक    अध्यात्मबाद   आजको  आवश्यकता,
विद्याथीलाई सुसंस्कार युक्त शिक्षा हाम्रो प्रतिबद्धता।”
 भन्ने मूल नाराका साथ पूर्वाञ्चलको सिरहा जिल्ला धनगढी गा.बि.स बार्ड नं १ मा सगरमाथा प्रज्ञा पीठका नाममा आधुनिक गुरुकुल स्थापना भयो । यसको संचालन सफलता पूर्वक अगाडी बढ्दै गएपछि दोस्रो बर्षमै अन्यत्र कहाँ कहाँ चल्न सक्छ भनेर मेची महाकाली प्रज्ञा अभियानको कार्यक्रम बनाएर संभाब्यता अध्ययनको क्रममा झापाको बाहुनडाँगी देखि कञ्चनपुरको सुखासाल सम्म ११ अञ्चलको भ्रमण गरियो । 
	संचालनमा आएको आधुनिक गुरुकुलको नमुना सगरमाथा प्रज्ञा पीठ सोनापुर धनगढी सिरहामा छ भने चल्न सक्ने सम्भाबना देखिएकाहरु मध्ये झापाको बाहुनडाँगी, कपिलबस्तुको बाणगंगा, दाङको घोराही, बाँकेको कम्दी, कैलालीको अत्तरीया र कञ्चनपुरको सुखासाल अगाडी आएका छन् । प्रज्ञा पुस्तकालयको हकमा माण्डब्य प्रज्ञा पुस्तकालय डमकडा मदनपोखरा पाल्पा र श्री चितवन कालिका मन्दिर भरतपुर १० मा सुरुवात भएको छ । 
	बाल संस्कारशालाको लागि महाकाली, सेती, भेरी, राप्ती चार अञ्चलका निम्नानुसार १७ ठाँउमा नमुनाको रुपमा एक एक कक्षा संचालन गरेर देखाइयो । ः–
नमुना कक्षा संचालन गरिएका स्कूल क्याम्पसहरु ः

यी कक्षा अवलोकन गरिसकेपछि क्याम्पस प्रमुख, शिक्षक, अभिभावक, ब्यबस्थापन समिति, विद्यार्थीको प्रतिक्रियामा हप्तामा कम्तिमा एउटा यस्तो कक्षा चल्नु पर्छ भन्ने सबैको रुचि र चाहना थियो । त्यसलाई ध्यानमा राखि प्रत्येक विद्यालयमा ६,७ र ८ कक्षाका विद्यार्थीहरुलाई शिक्षाकै साथमा विद्या पनि दिने उद्देश्यले उपयुक्त विषयबस्तुहरु समेत संकलन गरी बाल संस्कारशाला आचार्य मार्गदर्शिकाको तयारी भइसकेको छ ।
 मानव जीवन ब्यबस्थापनका लगि विश्व ब्यापि वैज्ञानिक अध्यात्मवादको नाम हो विचार क्रान्ति अर्थात अब्यबस्थित रुपमा चलेको जीवन क्रमलाई ब्यवस्थित बनाउनको लागि गरिने विचार परिवर्तन सबैको चिन्तन चरित्र र ब्यवहारमा परिवर्तन आउँदा युग नै परिवर्तन हुने हुँदा यसलाई युग निर्माण योजना पनि भनिन्छ । यसको लागि मनुष्यमा प्रज्ञा जागृत गराउन अभियान चलाउन पर्ने भएकोले यसलाई प्रज्ञा अभियान पनि भनिन्छ । मानव मस्तिष्कमा सद्बुद्धि जगाउने हतियार गायत्री महामन्त्र भएकोले गायत्री साधकहरुको यस संगठनलाई अखिल विश्व गायत्री परिवार पनि भनिन्छ । यसको काम सज्जनहरुलाई संगठित गर्नु , सत्प्रवृति संबर्धन गर्नु मनुष्यमा देवत्व भर्नु धरतीमा स्वर्ग अवतरण गराउन समाजलाई सुसंस्कृत बनाउनु हो ।
प्रज्ञा अभियान नेपाल भित्रका कार्यक्रमहरु ः–
१. प्रज्ञा पाठशाला (आधुनिक गुरुकुल) २. प्रज्ञा पुस्तकालय ३. प्रज्ञा बाल संस्कारशाला 
बाल संस्कारशालामा त्यस्तो के छ ?
	प्रत्येक मा.बि. मा कक्षा ६,७ र ८ मा नैतिक शिक्षाको साथमा र गाँउ समाजमा भएका १० देखि १४ बर्ष सम्मका बाल बालिकाहरुको बिचमा बाल संस्कारशालाको कक्षा चलाएर अनुशासन, चरित्र, नैतिकता, कर्तब्य परायणता, माता पिता गुरु प्रति श्रद्धा, पितृभक्ति, समाज सेवा,राष्ट्र भक्ति,राष्ट्रिय एकता,समता,सचिता,शिष्टता,शालीनता,सभ्यता, खान पान रहन सहन सदाचार सुसंस्कार आदि कुराको ज्ञान दिएमा उनीहरु कहिल्लै नबिग्रने र माथिल्ला कक्षामा पुग्दा पनि अनुशासनमा रहने हुनाले पठन पाठनमा सुबिधा हुने समेत अनुभवी शिक्षकहरुको निष्कर्ष रहेको छ । 
मानब जीवनको प्राण हो संस्कार ।
सभ्य समाजको आधार बाल संस्कार ।।
बाल संस्कार शालाको मुख्य उद्देश्य के हो ?
बा ः बालकहरुमा दिब्य गुणहरुको बिकास गराउने ।
ल ः लक्ष्य निर्धारण गरेर अगि बढ्न सिकाउने ।
सं ः संस्कार र संस्कृतिको ज्ञान गराएर त्यसको संबर्धन गर्न लगाउने ।
स्  ः स्मरण शक्ति बढाउने, स्वाध्यायी,स्वावलम्बी र स्वयंसेबी बनाउने । 
का ः कार्यक्षमता कार्यकुशलता बढाउने ।
र ः रचनात्मक शैलीबाट मानवीय गुणहरु बढाउने ।
शा ः शालीन शिष्ट र सभ्य ब्यक्तित्व तयार गर्ने ।
ला ः लाखौं मणिमा एउटा चम्किलो हीरा बनाउने ।
	प्रज्ञा पीठ संचालन गर्ने ब्यक्तिहरु  कम्तिमा पनि सज्जनहरुको संगठन सत्प्रबृति संबर्धन भन्न सुहाउने, सात्विक खानपान, सादा जीवन उच्च बिचार अवलम्बन गर्ने , सम्पत्ति ब्यक्तिगन स्वार्थपूर्तिको साधन मात्रै होइन सामाजिक प्रतिष्ठाका लागि पनि सदुपयोग गर्न सकिन्छ भन्ने बुझेको, लोकसेवाको भावनाले ओतप्रोत भएको हुनुपर्दछ । नाफा कमाउने उद्देश्य भन्दा पुण्य परमार्थ कमाउने मानसिकताले संचालन हुनुपर्दछ ।
	आधुनिक गुरुकुल (प्रज्ञा पीठ) मा पढाउने गुरुहरु पनि साधना, स्वाध्याय, स्ांयम सेवालाई अवलम्बन गर्न सक्ने, मानब जीवन ब्यबस्थापनका लागि विश्वब्यापी वैज्ञानिक अध्यात्मवाद संग संबन्धित प्रज्ञा अभियानका संचालक पूज्य गुरुदेव द्वारा दीक्षित, युगनिर्माण योजनाको कार्यक्रमबाट प्रशिक्षित, आफुलाई नोकर सम्झिने मानसिकताबाट उठेर आफ्नो भाग्यको निर्माता आफै बन्ने र आफ्नो मालिक आफै हुने हिम्मत भएको, अनुशासन, चरित्र, नैतिकता, कर्तब्य परायणता, समाज सेवा, राष्ट्र भक्तिको साथै शिष्ट सभ्य शालीन र सुसंस्कार सम्पन्न हुनुपर्दछ । किनकि आफू संग नभएको चीज अरुलाई दिन सकिदैन ।
“शिक्षाले मात्र पुग्दैन ज्ञान नदिई हुदैन ।
शिक्षकमै छैन भने विद्यार्थीले पाउँदैन ।।“
	पहिले पहिले गुरुकुलमा दिइने शिक्षा गुणग्राही हुन्थ्यो । अहिले त्यो छैन । आज विद्याथीले विद्या आर्जन गर्न पाएका छैनन किनकि आज आचार्य छैनन । गुरु शिष्य परम्पराको अभाव छ । शिक्षा केवल अर्थोपार्जनको साधन बनेको छ । शिक्षकको ध्यान पैसामा , विद्यार्थीको ध्यान सर्टिफिकेट हात पार्नुमा । यस्तो अवस्थामा राष्ट्रलाई आवश्यक पर्ने दक्ष जनशक्ति कसरी उत्पादन हुन सक्छ ? ब्यक्तिगत र पारिवारिक जीवनको उत्थान कसरी हुन्छ ? कसरी समाज र राष्ट्रको उन्नती प्रगती हुन्छ ?
एउटा कुशल शिक्षकले विद्यार्थीको दिमाग सफा गरिदिन्छ , राम्रा कुरा भरिदिन्छ ,भावना निर्माण गरिदिन्छ विचार क्रान्ति गरिदिन्छ । मनुष्यता भरिदिन्छ अर्थात एउटा असल नागरिक तयार गरेर समाजलाई दिन्छ छोटकरीमा भन्दा सभ्य समाज निर्माण गर्नुमा सबै भन्दा ठूलो भूमिका शिक्षकको हुन्छ जुन काम अरु कसै बाट सम्भव देखिदैन । शिक्षकले कोर्षमा भएका कुरामात्रै पढाएर पुग्दैन राम्रा कुरा जहाँबाट पनि ल्याएर विद्यार्थीलाई दिन जान्नु पर्दछ । किनकि ब्यक्ति निर्माण, परिवार निर्माण समाज निर्माण राष्ट्र निर्माण सबै शिक्षकले नै गर्ने हो । तर त्यो गर्नलाइ सबैभन्दा पहिले आफुलाई निर्माण गर्नु पर्दछ । आफै नसुध्रेकोले अरुलाई सुधार्ने अधिकार पनि हुदैन र संभव पनि छैन । शिक्षक स्वयं चन्चले छ , धर्यता छैन , स्वाध्याय गर्दैन ध्यान धारणाको महत्वनै बुझेको छैन भने विद्यार्र्थीलाई ज्ञान के दिन्छ ।
	ज्ञान थोपर्ने कुरा होइन उसको सुतेको ज्ञानलाई जगाउने मात्र हो । त्यसैले पढाउनु भन्दा पढ्न प्रेरित गर्नु ठूलो कुरा हो । शिक्षकको काम पढाई प्रतिको भोक जगाई दिनु हो । त्यसको लागि यी पाँच प्रकृया अपनाउनु पर्दछ । १. सूचक , २ दर्शन , ३. वाचक , ४. प्रेरक र ५.बोधक बन्नु पर्दछ । 
	कार्यक्रम छ, योजना बन्छ, काम हुन्छ, असम्भव भन्ने केही हुदै हुन्न ।""Nothing is impossible everything is possible"" त्यसै भनिएको होइन ।

Until about 1963 Dhankuta Bazaar was the administrative headquarters for the whole of north-eastern Nepal. Located a half mile above the town were the buildings of the Bada Hakim, the feudal district governor of the whole north-eastern region, a man with enormous power. The town also had the regional jail and army post. Because of Dhankuta's isolation from the lowland Terai and from Kathamandu, it was in many ways a self-governing area.Income to purchase items that could not be produced locally came from a combination of sales of hill produce and funds repatriated back into the hills by Gorkha soldiers serving first in the British and then more-often in the Indian armies.The first five American Peace Corps Volunteers arrived in Dhankuta Bazaar in Fall, 1962 to work as teachers in the two high schools. In October, 1963 three male PCV's arrived to help establish the new Panchayat Development program.From 1963 Nepal was divided into 75 Panchayat Districts, and the traditional Dhankuta administrative region was divided up into about six of the panchayat districts. The power of the Bada Hakim was transferred to the central government's appointed Panchayat Development Officer and each district's elected Panchayat President.During the pre-panchayat period Dhankuta Bazaar prided itself as being in the cultural vanguard, a relatively progressive community with its own ""intellectual"" elite. Dhankuta Bazaar, already in the 1930s, had the only high school in Nepal to be located outside of the Kathmandu Valley. Early on it added a girl's high school and a two-year college.","""""","""""","""""","""""","""""",City,"""""","""""",""""""

Guranse  is situated at an altitude between 3,500 to 7,200 ft above sea level which makes it one of the highest tea gardens in the world. it lies nestled below the Makalu Mountain Range in the Eastern Hills of Nepal, Dhankuta, hence the richness in flavor and aroma. This garden produces only premium  high grown orthodox tea. 

(The name Guranse is the Nepali local name for the Rhododendron- which is abundant in that area, and also the official flower of Nepal or otherwise called Laliguranse.)

The plantation has been planted with pure, young, vibrant clonal bushes which were selected with the utmost care keeping in mind quality.

Guranse makes Oolong tea, White teas, Green teas, Hand rolled teas, Red teas and fine orthodox Black teas.

Guranse Tea Estate has received a wide range of awards and recognitions for excellence.

-  The Honor Certificate for Quality in the Second China International Tea Exposition, 1999

-   Organic certified by The National Association for Sustainable Agriculture, Australia (NASAA) and JAS 

-   Certified ISO 22000:2005

This tea estate is also a socially responsible employer. We believe in the upliftment of the Nepali women, hence 95% of our workers are women. Guranse also sponsors the education of several under privileged  children, and upkeeps and built a home for the aged in the area.

Guranse Tea Estate has helped to uplift the social economy by supporting farmers with training so that individual families can grow and own their own small organic tea gardens, thus giving farmers sustainable livelihoods and strengthening the rural economy. Guranse then buys the leaf from these farmers. 

By sharing what we know and learn, we have been the catalyst for the adoption of sustainable practices between farmers and ourselves in the area. Previously people from the area went in search of jobs elsewhere. With the establishment of the estate, the factory and training of local farmers, the native and indegenous people are gainfully employed and now prefer to stay home and earn there itself uplifting the entire area. 

Guranse exports its teas to the US, Japan, Europe. The company is FDA registered. 

Currently Guranse produces about 45,000 kgs of tea per season out of which 20,000 kgs is for the export market. 10% of this is Specialty tea like hand rolled, oolongs, white teas and hand sorted green.  The rest are green tea and black orthodox tea.
