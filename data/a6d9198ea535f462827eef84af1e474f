After spending two weeks in Kathmandu and dealing with the traffic, smells, and noise of the city, this was exactly what we needed. Although we had limited time left to stay here, we left feeling refreshed and revitalized and feeling much more positive than when we walked through the door upon our arrival. The staff and other guests were all so friendly and amazing. The location is truly magical, especially if you are looking for a retreat away from the hussle and bustle of the city. The guided meditation and chanting were my favorite exercises, and the FOOD!! Best food I had the whole trip in Nepal.  If I would have had more time, I would have loved to stay longer, but something tells me I will be back. ",

My fast-paced NYC lifestyle left me craving some time for quiet reflection, yoga, and enjoyment of nature--and that's exactly what I found at Sadhana. I couldn't have asked for a better experience.\n\nEveryone that I came into contact with--both fellow travelers and the Sadhana staff--really added to my experience. In particular, Bipin really took the time to get to know me and engage with me about my reasons for coming to Sadhana. It was the first time that I articulated why I had traveled half-way across the world to do yoga and meditation everyday and his genuine, caring nature allowed me to really appreciate the gift of being at such a special place.\n\nI had such a lovely experience at Sadhana. I cannot recommend it highly enough.",

After 4 days of daily flushing by increasing the amount of salted water that flushed down my intestines, I literally felt clean as never. I took conscious of my body and how it worked. If you want to do it, just do it ! It definitely worth doing it.\n\nFew words on the food. It was simply A-MA-ZING. I don't remember the chef's name, but she's my Shiva. She deserves to be a goddess, now ! By far, the best food I had in Nepal. \n\nAll the staff were truly awesome, helpful, smiling and extraordinarily kind.\n\nI left the center clean and rejuvenated.
