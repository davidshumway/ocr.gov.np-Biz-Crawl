Away from the bustle of Thamel without feeling remote.\n- Comfortable accommodations, nice view from roof and terrace\n- In-house kitchen/bar\n- Reasonable rates for Kathmandu\n\nCons:\nPrepare to be treated as a captive audience for a never-ending sales pitch for the local treks. I expressed very little interest in trekking when I checked in, nevertheless the trekking expert was summoned to sit down and give me the hard sell, an exhaustive look at every local trek, with pricing breakdowns, discounts, guilt trip, the whole package.\nAfter responding with a polite \"I'll think about it\" I was hounded every day about it afterwards, multiple times a day, by each of the different staff who would seek me out in the dining area, on the terrace or even on the roof while I had my cigarette, and always first thing in the morning, before I'd had my breakfast or even been greeted.\nAs soon as I made it clear I had no intention of doing a trek with them, the hospitality quickly evaporated. As I was checking out I was instructed to write an 'excellent' review.\n\nMaybe a good place to stay if you plan to trek or enjoy spending every minute with pushy salesmen.",

Some meals were pricier than local food, but they easily had the best non-Nepali food in the city (try their burgers). Staff are friendly and laid back, and each person has their own set of great tips and advice on things to do. This hostel is not for people who can't handle a little Nepali-style \"roughing it\" and need to be pampered.\n\nBe sure to coordinate directions with the staff - most taxi drivers are lying when they say they know where it is.",
