I also recommend the hot Tang drink.  Be careful on the hiking trail just to the South of here. It seems to be popular, but it seemed rather strenuous and a bit risky to me.  Honestly, if you prefer a bit more pampering there are a few places in Kathmandu and Lhasa that may be more to your liking.  The porters and yaks are most helpful and friendly here though, so tip them well.  \n",
