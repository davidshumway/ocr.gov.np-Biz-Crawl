STAY AWAY . the locals informed me to the same conclusion i did after a while. he keeps you guessing and in pain as so you come back over and over again ,  till either its to late for a fair treatment. or death.\nI walk around Darjeeling and since im in an issue with broken bones many people come and ask if i am alright.Then the stories come out ..........\nPlease if you are able go to Siliguri , calcutta or home, go .......................\nPS: I dont like the word HATE on the star scale but it was worst than the first star which is the worst",
