I and my friend stayed here around 10 day before and after trek in October 2011. we feel here “home away from home” There is a very friendly atmosphere; all staff are like my second family. They are always listening to our needs; they are ready to reach the moon to satisfy us. \nThey give us the same room backside of hotel both time and this is great! Hotel is clean, quiet and close to the center of Thamel. In Nepal, every day power cuts but the hotel is equipped with generator. There is also a WiFi! On the roof, Solar panels produce electricity for hot water. All Staff are very nice and they are good cooker. Since the roof, which is a very pleasant place to stay, you can admire a big part of Kathmandu as well as Swayambunath = monkey Temple. I suggest to choose this hotel in Kathmandu for all as a home away your home\nThanks to all the staff for their kindness and there helpfulness. \nSee you soon!",
