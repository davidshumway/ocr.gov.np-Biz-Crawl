            "text" : "I purchased a Dining Table Set  (Model No F014) from the City Centre 2 Estillo Showroom on 10 August 2014(Order No: 2249). The total price for this set (1 Table + 4 Chairs) was Rs 18.200/-. This set was delivered on the first week of September 2014.  The quality of the rexine covers of the chairs is so pathetic that just in about two months the rexine is showing splits. Today (24 November 2014) when I spoke to one of the officials in Estillo, he informed that the rexine covers need to be changed, for which the cost per chair will be Rs 4200/-. He also informed that their products have a service warranty, but any material costs have to be borne by the customers! This is not surprising, as most of the products now-a-days come with a service warranty. What is surprising is the PATHETIC QUALITY of the product. Just in two months of getting the product, it is leading me to spend another 8400 bucks on it as repairs!!! I would definitely not recommend Estillo to anyone I know. Moreover, if all those chairs are not replaced in the next seven days, I am going to lodge a complaint with the consumer forum!!",
