But that was just not going to happen when I met his nice chap of 21 named Karan having his Car Accessories Store near Dhaka Kalibari in Prince Anwar Shat Road Kolkata.\n\nI was there to fit a speaker for my Scorpio Car and thought of installing a system which is more pricier. He then took the pain of installing that and then much lower configuration one. He said that lower one should suit me as I already have a SubWoofer and it is true. He has just looked above his profit and give a excellent suggestion.\n\nIt was a pleasure to talk to him the two hours I was there and wish he will succeed in life.",
