            "text" : "Sales ppl have no idea about the products. Service is really bad. \n\nFew days back, I made a lot of purchase (70K) at croma and I was told that it will be delivered the next day anytime in between 10am - 8pm with a warning that If I miss the delivery it will not be sent again. \n\nSo basically it mean there are no time window (in between 1030 am to 1130am or 0300pm to 0500pm) its the whole day. Which mean if you shop at croma you had to leave every work the consecutive day and wait at home for the whole day. \n\nIn my case my purchase was finally delivered at 0800pm on the following day. Now the fun begin. 1. They delivered the wrong product, KUDOS!! 2. Microwave oven was missing the cooking accessories,understood mistake HAPPENS!! 3. I had bought extended warranty for all the four products that I purchased BUT all the papers were missing, very IRRESPONSIBLE!! 3. When I complained they sent over the papers Immediately but only for two products 4.Regarding Micro Wave cooking accessories I was told that they ran out of stock and I should keep checking the store for the availability. WHAT?? 5. On receiving the incomplete papers yet again, I once again called the staff and I was told to come and collect it from store since they have staff shortage, once again WHAT??\n\nSo, I went to the store, where I was sent around the counters. Finally, I had to put my chivalry aside (anyway I had run out of patience by this time) and gave the store manager a piece of my mind. It was only after all the customer started paying attention to the screw up on such high purchase value and within next 15 mins I had the Microwave cooking accessories (which was supposedly out of stock) and all the papers in order.  \n\nBy the way it all happened a day before Diwali. Thx Croma for the Diwal Gift.\n\nRgds\nShorav",
