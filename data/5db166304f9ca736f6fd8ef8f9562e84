It offers regular connections to Kathmandu and Jomsom; and seasonal connections to Manang. Following a new agreement on air travel between India and Nepal, Pokhara is to be the site of Nepal's second international airport. Construction started in the southeast of Pokhara in 2009 but is only progressing slowly. In 2011 Buddha Air, a Nepali private airline, began international flights from Pokhara to Chaudhary Charan Singh International Airport in Lucknow, India, and has announced plans to fly to New Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport in the future.The apron of the airport is tiny and can only handle 8 small propeller planes at a time. Pokhara Airport is a diversion airport for the main airport TIA in times of problems such as fog, and due to short runway and crowded apron often must re-divert flights to third airports with even shorter runways.The airport is capable to handle aircraft from the Nepalese Army Air Service.Incidents and accidents6 November 1997 \u2013 A Necon Air Avro 748-100 (9N-ACM), after a flight from Kathmandu, suffered a hydraulic system failure after landing at Pokhara Airport and ran off the runway.

","mission":"\"Uniting Youth From The Whole World \"","general_info":"***************** ABOUT NEPAL ******************* \t \n\nNepal is a small but beautiful country squeezed in between India and China. With a land mass no bigger than Tasmania in Australia, Nepal still manages to provide amazing contrasts - from the Indian border with flat and fertile plains only 100m above sea level; to amazing jungles with tigers and rhinos running wild; and of course to the magnificent 8000m-high mountain range, the Himalayas. \n\nThe Himalayas are a breathtaking vista of awesome snow-capped mountains, including the world's tallest - Mount Everest. Nepal's mountains make it a very popular destination for mountaineers and trekkers alike. The fast flowing rivers and steep rock faces also place Nepal high on the list of adventure tourism destinations.\n\nNepal's physical beauty is matched by the rich cultural diversity of her traditions and people. Nepal's population currently stands at more than 23 million people, the majority of whom are Hindu.\nNepal is also the birthplace of the Buddha and Buddhism and Buddhist traditions are very strong.  In fact, many of the religious celebrations are a mix of Hinduism and Buddhism and have been that way for many centuries.\n\nDespite its beauty, Nepal is a very poor country, with serious issues of poverty, including infant and child mortality, malnutrition, lack of access to safe drinking water, poor sanitation, illiteracy and preventable diseases. In this setting other serious issues have arisen such as human trafficking, child abuse and child labour. Nepal's environment is also suffering from pollution, deforestation and unregulated use of natural resources. \n\nAdditionally, and unfortunately for Nepal and her people, a serious internal conflict ravaged the country from 1991 until a ceasefire was declared in 2006. During the conflict more than 13,000 Nepali men, women and children lost their lives and there has been terrible destruction to infrastructure, including many schools, roads and hospitals. It will take Nepal many years to recover.\n\nThe rural areas were particularly hard hit by the civil war, where the conflict together with abject poverty made life incredibly difficult. Hardest hit have been the children, as poverty and conflict make life cheap and children\u2019s needs are often neglected. It is not uncommon for a widow or widower to remarry and subsequently abandon one or all of the children from the previous marriage - sometimes with relatives, oftentimes not.\n","category_list":[{"id":"186825111351005","name":"Tourist Attraction"}],"cover":{"cover_id":"818848451529033","source":"https:\/\/scontent.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-xfa1\/v\/t1.0-9\/s720x720\/11102779_818848451529033_3628870094235833443_n.jpg?oh=880e42bd77cdf5abdc13b02477786389&oe=55E028B5","offset_y":100,"offset_x":0}},{"category":"Hotel","id":"1005419372821511","name":"New Futureway Guest House","likes":234,"talking_about_count":2,"were_here_count":3,"location":{"street":"Baidam 6 pokhara centre point","city":"Pokhra","country":"Nepal","zip":"","latitude":28.2333,"longitude":83.9833},"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/New-Futureway-Guest-House\/1005419372821511","phone":"009779856038307","category_list":[{"id":"197289820310880","name":"Home"}],"cover":{"cover_id":"1005428876153894","source":"https:\/\/scontent.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-xfp1\/v\/t1.0-9\/s720x720\/10993389_1005428876153894_3455762710482976503_n.jpg?oh=27f6f4f75fbcf472e99e1dfb4dad8918&oe=55C4CA5A","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}},{"category":"City","id":"103403866360683","name":"Pokhar, Nepal","likes":1669,"talking_about_count":1029,"were_here_count":6524,"location":{"street":"","zip":"\u003C\u003Cnot-applicable>>","latitude":28.2333,"longitude":83.9833},"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Pokhar-Nepal\/103403866360683","category_list":[{"id":"224455390913969","name":"City"}]},{"category":"Local business","id":"393136244100685","name":"Tersapatti, Pokhara","likes":29,"talking_about_count":90,"were_here_count":1653,"location":{"street":"Tersapatti","city":"Pokhara","country":"Nepal","zip":"","latitude":28.229187304246,"longitude":83.987307904104},"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Tersapatti-Pokhara\/393136244100685","category_list":[{"id":"192049437499122","name":"Residence &amp;

Local and global. We aim to preserve and create upon the already beautiful surrounding nature an ecological farm community which will be a fine example for people around the world who are inquisitive about organic food, and living. We believe that in these times it is clearly imperative that humanity take seriously the efforts to address the problems of the world caused by contaminated foods, and natural resources. The solution we feel, as many do, is to preserve and expand the awareness and produce of the organic culture. Foods produces organically, meaning they are not contaminated with chemicals, antibiotics, or neither modified genetically (GMO) are healthier, tastier and friendly to the environment.\nConnected already with local farmers we mean to establish a center for educating more and more people in the practical application of organic farming. Their knowledge of the land and of techniques of farming passed down the ages are to be consciously preserved. Uniting with this will be knowledge brought in from other sources around the world as we aim to gather knowledge regarding the organic agri-culture. We will market and distribute accordingly.\nBy bringing attention to organic farming we will create awareness of its importance and its science all over the world. We have plans to advertise through many mediums the importance of good food, and natural living, not only in Nepal but throughout the world. Presenting ourselves in festivals around the world we will not only bring attention to the cause of organic farming but to Nepal itself, thereby giving good representation in the growing field of sustainable living.\nAs our local concern is Nepal, we will be working with local farmers to raise the standard of living in the rural areas. In this way, other non-organic farms may take note and decide to become organic. To assist with this we will develop our site into a working sustainable community.\nThe community, which will not be isolated but integrated with the locality, will create schools for adults and for children. The school for adults will be to educate all who desire the education regarding organic farming etc. Also we will teach many subjects such as health preservation and care, ayurveda, yoga etc along with standard education subjects such as mathematics, English and science. In this way, the locals teach and are taught, and visitors invited for sharing we teach and be taught. These sharing schools will contribute to the preservation of knowledge in our future society.\nSuch a school, created locally in Nepal, may then be forged again and again in other areas, in Nepal and also around the world.\nWe will create also a school for children and invite poor and orphaned children to come and study. Again the subjects studied will be a mix of practical, spiritual, and social.\nOne aim of our project is for our children to be content with their beautiful home, so they feel proud with no need to leave for foreign lands for education or entertainment.\nOn the contrary, we will instead receive folks from all over the world who wish to absorb the local culture while simultaneously creating a new culture which is a blend of old and new.\nEntertainment will also therefore is also an important concern, for teenagers have a natural need, and a natural thirst for enjoyment and creation. We will create for them a music studio, and bring in teachers of music from Nepal and all around the world. In this way local music traditions may be preserved and foreign traditions may be received and integrated, with no need of travelling far.\nAs well as a studio we aim to create art schools and craft schools within the community, again, preserving and educating locals and visitors about our culture.\nAlongside the practical is also the spiritual. We will create space for the teaching of spiritual sciences such as yoga and meditation. Such places will not be merely utilized for show but to educate those interested in this regard so they may continue the teachings of a rich heritage.\nAll-in-all we aim to create a wonderful community where people are happy to co-exist, in nature. The success of this will surely be an education to anyone who recognizes as we do the problems created by separating the city life from the rural life, where farmers farm with no access to other community activities. In this way rural living will again be desired and our children will not wish to run to cities around the world where a struggle to compete with millions of people for money awaits them.\nWe wish to share these ideas and creations with the people of Nepal and also inspire local people around the world to enjoy local living, and resurrect it in the minds of people, so that our food becomes predominantly organic again, so that our usage of pollutants becomes minimized, so that our health and happiness be with us constantly.\nWe engage various workshops where local Nepali people as well as people from around the world will present their original crafts and skills, lecture on ancient Yoga and meditation techniques, New Age life style green ways, recycling, composting and how to contribute for the preservation of the Nature and Mother Earth.\nGhaderi Eco Village is nestled in the hills over-looking Pokhara, bearing constant witness to the magnificent Annapurna ranga. It is a cosy village where locals grow there own organic food and live a happy life. It is a piece of heaven. Upon that ready heaven there is further ambition to cultivate a culture where much more than farming is seen. What the local life can teach is much yet children brought up in these villages still yearn for the adventures of the city and so the youth more often than not leave in search for another type of heaven. One that invariably does not exist.\nThe goal of Ghaderi Eco Village is to bring awareness to the world of the heaven that exists in these rurals communities, and invite people to experience this first hand. Also we desire to rejuvenate the local scene by sharing ideas from all over the world.\nThus we have Permaculture meeting with local culture, western traditional music meeting with local traditional music, and the convergence of other arts and philosophies such as yoga, meditation, reiki, massage etc.\nWhat is being created is the future. A merger of east and west, of new and old, of earth and spirit. We aim to build a school nearby which hosts local children and children visiting from all around the world, so that knowledge and love may be shared. We aim to establish an ashram and invite teachers to teach various subjects from all fields of esoteric study. We will create a music studio so that musicians from all around the world are attracted to come and enjoy the perfect place to create music of all types. And so that locals may produce sounds the world may also hear.\nGhaderi Eco Village is therefore not an isolated experiment but the creation of future upon what has been preserved so well from ages. The locals are happy to see new colors, and visitors are happy to experience the hospitality of the locals and the sheer beauty of the place. We invite you to join us in our growth, in our uniting, in our sharing and creating of what must surely be an example for humanity. In these times it is essential to retrace our steps and apply natural wisdom in our future culture on Planet Earth. Where that respect for nature is let us maintain it, and from whose hearts that respect lies, let it be shared.\nWe will host different kinds of festivals here and hope to see you one day, sharing what you know and learning what you may not.\nIn unity we thus grow, and enjoy abundantly in this heaven in the hills.\n\nPhone\t+977 9804121677+977 9805865724\nEmail\trameshgiri\u0040hotmail.com\nWebsite\thttp:\/\/www.unityecovillage.com\/\n\nLOCATION:\n12 km from Lakeside -Pokhara .\nGhaderi Eco Village\nChapakot -6 , Pokhara\nhttp:\/\/mapcarta.com\/27946148 \u2014\n\n\n\n","mission":"Our mission is two-fold.

The institution offers undergraduate and graduate programs. It is named after the king Prithivi Narayan Shah credited for the unification of Nepal in its modern form.HistoryThe campus, initially named Prithivi Narayan College, was established in Sept. 1, 1960 as the first community college of the Kaski district for post secondary education as a local effort. In its initial years the classes were conducted in Ratna Rajya Laxmi High School. In 1961 it was granted public land in Bhimkali Patan, Bagar where it currently exists. Regarded as one of the largest affiliate campuses of Tribhuvan University (TU) it is a major center for post secondary education in the western region of the country.The campus is regarded as one of the important educational institutions in the country and receives government grants distributed through the TU. In accordance with the TU decentralization act of 1998 the campus elected a management committee in Sept. 1999 which handles tasks such as construction of physical infra-structure, making rules, working plan and economic policies and a sub committee under the management committee looks after every day affairs of the campus. The campus is spread over 35 hectares along on the banks of the Seti Gandaki River. The campus buildings occupy only a part of this area; most of the land owned is open. In 2006, UNDP Global Environmental funded a project to develop this open space as Green Space Park, where university students could learn about environmental conservation and demonstrate the use of open space to serve the leisure and recreational needs of the growing urban population of Pokhara. The campus is regarded as one of the most picturesque in the country.","category_list":[{"id":"108051929285833","name":"College &amp; University"}]},{"category":"Media\/news\/publishing","id":"731810883555412","name":"Everest Mice & Event Management Company","likes":1585,"talking_about_count":97,"were_here_count":45,"location":{"street":"Nepal","city":"Pokhara","country":"Nepal","zip":"","latitude":28.2639,"longitude":83.9722},"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/everest.mice","category_list":[{"id":"2233","name":"Media\/News\/Publishing"}],"cover":{"cover_id":"736708416398992","source":"https:\/\/scontent.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-xpa1\/v\/t1.0-9\/10689934_736708416398992_7400100840391884017_n.jpg?oh=100419452ab146788075523d7cff8e3d&oe=55D69247","offset_y":38,"offset_x":0}},{"category":"School","id":"300943476640958","name":"The Gurkha Army Training School [GATS]","likes":3945,"talking_about_count":33,"were_here_count":75,"location":{"street":"Indramarg-10,","city":"Pokhara","country":"Nepal","zip":"Nepal ","latitude":28.2639,"longitude":83.9722},"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/The-Gurkha-Army-Training-School-GATS\/300943476640958","phone":"+977-06-1431085 & cell: +977-98460-53440 ","category_list":[{"id":"365182493518892","name":"School"}],"cover":{"cover_id":"690117504390218","source":"https:\/\/scontent.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-xpa1\/t31.0-8\/p480x480\/10626155_690117504390218_671702644070955947_o.jpg","offset_y":36,"offset_x":0}},{"category":"City","id":"104052812964372","name":"Pokhara","likes":200959,"talking_about_count":6441,"were_here_count":364960,"location":{"street":"","zip":"33700 (WRPD), 33702, 33704, 33706, 33708, 33713","latitude":28.2639,"longitude":83.9722},"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Pokhara\/104052812964372","description":"Pokhara lies in the centre of Kaski District, Gandaki Zone and the Western Development Region.

We have outgoing personalities and fluency in several languages, which helps us quickly develop trust with local people. We hope to inspire travelers of all ages to expand their geographic and cultural boundaries. We have travelled off the beaten path in more than 60 countries. Our recent trip to Nepal exceeded all our expectations! Why? Because we had the absolute good fortune to meet the Malla sisters in Pokhara.\n\nThe Malla Dynasty ruled Nepal from the 12th to 16th centuries. \n\nAt that time the name Malla indicated a person of great strength and power! In many ways the Malla period of rule in Nepal was much like the Italian Renaissance \u2026 Just visit Patan and walk amongst the many temples to understand that. Much like the extraordinary temples in Pagan the Malla sisters themselves are a hidden treasure waiting to be discovered \u2013 and to our everlasting pleasure we discovered them in Pokhara.\n\nOver a two week period we trekked in the Himalayas, biked in Pokhara, visited Para Gliding sites including the unbelievable para hawking experience with Steve & Anita Mason, boated and hiked above on Lake Begnas, took in the best museums in Pokhara\u2026. all under the guidance and loving care of the Malla sisters \u2026. Hira & Bishnu!\n\nThey are both not only competent \u2026 but incredibly fun to be with! This video is dedicated to them. They made our experience in Nepal a great success.
