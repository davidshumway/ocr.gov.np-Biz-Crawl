            "text" : "I heard about Annapurna furniture from one of my colleague. After telephonic discussion finally I visited their place at Nagerbazar. I was keen to make all my furniture with solid teak wood & plywood, but initially I was scared about my budget to get exceed. After long conversation & fruitful meeting with Mr. Kundu(one of partner) I decided to book site visit for modular kitchen, living room and one bedroom furniture. One week later I again visited their place to see 3d designs of the respective furniture & kitchen. Their design was very innovative & quotation was with full of detail description of material, sizes etc. The prices were reasonable as compare to the quality, but still I asked them to give little discount. After price negotiation I placed the final order...Mr Kundu is really a humble & generous person. \n\nI received the material after one and half month, which was 3 days earlier of actual time of delivery. The quality of the products was just awesome and with high level of craftsmanship, even beyond my expectation. I saw this kind of transparent high gloss PU finish on teak wood & veneer in US, but never earlier in Kolkata. They made all the compliances which were committed on time of placing order.  Kitchen hardwares were with Hetich brand, and edge band finishes of high gloss shutters were good. Their designs, suggestions, interior work really helped me to furnish my Newtown flat with well manner and good decor. Later I placed them more order for rest of my bedrooms ...I suggest everyone this organisation for good quality furniture at reasonable price in Kolkata. \n",

            "text" : "During May'14, I searched about good furniture store and found 'Annapurna' Furniture as 5 star rating. I went to their warehouse in Nagerbazar and ordered a 4 seater dining set made of segun wood of about 40K.The shop owner was very polite and we trusted him as he promised a delivery date after 3 weeks.Also, promised that they will make two more chairs for me in only 10K .After that, I couldn't follow up for about 1 month as I was busy. After 1 month, when I called them , they told me that they are building the structure. After 2 weeks, same update. We have chosen the ready made chairs but they sold those chairs to other customer. So now, they were making new chairs for me. After 5 follow up through out next 2 weeks, I finally decided to visit their store to see our Item and order the new two chairs. So, the dining set was ready without polish. We ordered the two more chairs but he denied to make it in 10K. He demanded 13K. We reminded him his promise but his attitude was like he cannot sell those two chair in only 10K price. We were really surprised with his attitude but then he escaped to his store room. His attitude in phone is kind of like customers are irritating him and in face to face meeting, customers are like god to him, totally opposite and really disappointing.\n\nNext day, however, with no other options, we have ordered two more chairs to make the dining set 6 seater. Finally, when we saw the final product, it was good but finishing touch is really disappointing. polish on segun wood was not upto mark and below the seat cover, the holes are visible in ply. We were really disappointed with product as it is not worth of 40K. After 1 week, they sent one labour to our house to do the polishing but he was so arrogent. We were scared that he might make the table look more bad.Also ,leveling to the floor was not good.\n\nAnnapruna furniture owner actually sent our orders to their contractors (who are small furniture labourer in Nagerbazar Area) and I have to say they did a good job in next two chairs than the previous 4 seater dining set.Polish and leveling was good surprisingly.\n\nMy last experience was horrible. After 1 week, they sent one labor to level the table stand properly. That labor was so much dull(I don't know how one renowned furniture store keeping these type stuffs) that he started cutting the wooden stand of the table with out knowing the issue. We tried to stop him but at that time, he did all the worst he could do with the table. previously , the table has 10% dispute, now he made it to 40% dispute. We told the same thing to Owner but he was not reactive to my loss ( didn't even say sorry to us) . This is really disappointing.\n\nHis words are big like he has shops in CC2, tollygunj but customer service is very much poor. Once you pay the bill, then his liability was finished. Furniture price is huge but quality is poor.Don't go with any promise as the chances of betray are more.His stuffs are of poor quality and they actually outsource their orders. You can find same product in low price and good customer service in other small furniture shops in Nagerbazar.I have some other items to order but decided to not to go for the same furniture mall.",
