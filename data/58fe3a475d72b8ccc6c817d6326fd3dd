Staff is very friendly and helpful. The location is excellent! The grounds were beautiful and clean. Negatives- The hot tub did not work the entire time we were there. We got a couples massage and the two women chit chated the entire massages making it difficult to fully relax. There was construction right next to the hotel that made it a bit noisy. We only tried the breakfast buffet there, but it definitely left something to be desired. \n\nAfter all is said and done I believe the hotel is pretty overpriced. I most likely would stay elsewhere if I went back to Pokhara, but did find it adequate and comfortable. ",
