            "text" : "I did Everest Base Camp trek with them last year (among a number of other tours after)! The trek was amazing and could honestly say that it was an adventure of a lifetime in itself, but what I gained after that, I never thought it would be the reason why would want to keep going back to Nepal…  The NEST team was very accommodating and arranged everything for us, even with very short notice. Their price was very competitive too!!!  \r\n\r\nRaj is also very nice, friendly and quite a resourceful guy – if you need to buy anything in Kathmandu like winter clothes, etc, make sure you go with him! He is sooooo good in bargaining, the price you would get is absolutely and ridiculously cheap, you would want to keep buying (but beware! You may not want to stop after!) !!  This guy also made our trip so worthwhile and something my bestfriend and I would forever remember and laugh (and cry) about! It was amazing how he handled and resolved issues so quickly and (very) calmly! When we were having trouble getting back to Kathmandu because of the weather in Lukla, Raj was able to find alternative ways on how we can go back to Kathmandu on time so we won’t miss our international flights.  \r\n\r\nNot only did he become our travel operator at that time, but he is also now a great friend since then - I have been back to Nepal three times since and he made me experience, not only the mountains, but also local culture, local tradition and local food (at one point, before I left Nepal, he did cook for me and my friend in his home!).  The group has since arranged my travels to other places in Nepal like Chitwan, Pokhara, Nagarkot, Dhulekhill, Sarangkot, mountain flight..  Aside from the mountains and the view of the Fish Tail, my favourite has always been the motorbike rides and endless night food trips with Raj and his friends! \r\n\r\nNeed I say more?  I could go on and on as the list is endless.. but anyone who met him would agree how fascinating and impressive Raj is along with his friends and the NEST team are! I love them all and Nepal very much! \r\n",
