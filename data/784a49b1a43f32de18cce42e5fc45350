The faculty and infrastructure are very good. The materials provided are student friendly and more than enough for your preparation. In fact you can never fall short of materials(question papers and practice sheets). The student's personal account in the career launcher website (SIS)contains hundreds of last year question papers, proctored and unproctored mocks, E-library, Test Series, educational games, news archive, GK supplements and Webinars to name a few. In short, the two yrs of my life in Career Launcher has been completely worthwhile and a satisfactory experience. Study is made a fun-filled activity, thanks to CL and my teachers.",

The classes were very well organised and really helped me to focus on the current happenings all over the world. Discussions were held on various topics and everyone was encouraged to come up with their own view point. Several Mock GDs were held and people,like me, with no prior experience at GDs should find the sessions extremely rewarding. The Mock PIs were even more abundant and more personalised. These sessions really helped me to deal with questions I wasn't very comfortable speaking about. \nI believe it is due to the extremely good guidance that I received from the faculty members, especially Sandeep Sir, that made it possible for me to convert IMT-G(Finance) last year and XL-HRM and IMT-G(Finance) this year.
