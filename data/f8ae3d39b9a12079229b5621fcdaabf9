We (a group of 4) did the Annapurna Circuit over the Thorong La Pass with a flight out of Jomsom. This was our first trip to Nepal. Arjun (co-owner) did everything from the onset to address our needs which included providing timely answers to all our questions (and we had lots) to designing a trek (and city tours of Kathmandu and Pokhara) that were tailored to our needs. He personally picked us up at the airport and from then on we were in good hands throughout the trip. Our guide, Dipak, was amazing and more than a guide!! We all quickly became friends. Dipak shared his knowledge of the local culture, mountain range and was more than happy to spend time teaching us the language and customs; making the whole Nepal experience perfect. Our porters, Krishna and Rajindra, were also amazing!!! Professional, pleasant and fun! The three of them were always around to address our needs; they were truly genuine, kind and attentive. \n\nThanks Arjun, Dipak, Krishna and Rajindra for making this a trip we’ll always remember!!! Hope to be back again!! \nVisited September 2013\n",
