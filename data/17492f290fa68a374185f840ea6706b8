With so many tour agencies in Nepal, it is a daunting task just picking one with hopes that they are reliable and trustworthy. Thankfully Global Link has proven to be just that. Raj was patient and knowledgeable with my incessant questioning and gave great support to our overall planning. We went for the slightly more elusive 8 day Mardi Himal trek. Our guide and porter, though young, were conscientious and helpful all along the way! As amateur trekkers, we climbed relatively slow but they made no sounds of impatience :) We paid reasonably for the trek and would definitely use their services again! High recommended! \n\nNicole from Singapore",
