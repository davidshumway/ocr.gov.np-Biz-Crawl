            "text" : "Stayed here with my wife on our honeymoon in late April 2011. Spacious rooms and delicious food in a beautiful setting. The best part of our stay was our guide, Shiva. He was knowledgeable and honest, taking us on a boat ride down the river and a walk through the jungle where we came very close to two rhinoceros, a crocodile, several muntjac, spotted deer, and even a baby tiger! Leopard prints, tiger scratches on the bark of trees. A true adventure! His knowledge of the medicinal uses of plants and the complex lives of the forest dwelling animals was enlightening. Not to mention his polite demeanour and realistic perspective on life. We also participated in an elephant safari, which took is into the jungle on elephant back in the late afternoon, when we saw another five rhinoceros! An amazing experience. Would recommend this place to anyone who knows what they are getting themselves into when traveling Nepal. ",
