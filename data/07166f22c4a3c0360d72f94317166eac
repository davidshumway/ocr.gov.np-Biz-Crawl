The circuit is a bit touristic, but still the nature is phenomenal and in the off season it is really not crowded, in May the weather is still great. I did the tour with a great company which called Nature House Treks and Expedition and would like to write about them. Nature House Treks and Expedition is a really professional and care a lot about their customers. They can provide you nearly everything and the prices are really reasonable, especially compared to other trekking agencies. Everyone I met was really friendly and welcoming and I always had a good feeling travelling with Nature House. I did the Annapurna circuit with Nature House Treks and Expedition which was an excellent experience, so from my point\n I can just give a strong recommendation.\n",
