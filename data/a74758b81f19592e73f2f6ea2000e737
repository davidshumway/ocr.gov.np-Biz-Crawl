            "text" : "Hi,\n\nMy name is Sumit Agarwal and I own a Maruti Swift VDi (2008 model) DL 2C P 7462. I have been driving a Maruti car for almost a decade now (Maruti 800, followed by Maruti Esteem). And ever since I started driving, I have been getting my car serviced at Motorcraft, Sector-8, Noida.\n\nSo, I was fully satisfied with the quality of service and attitude of the people there. They were helpful, cooperative and trustworthy. But my last few visits to Motorcraft have been horrible.\n\nI visited motorcraft in May end for my regular service. I had few problems which I even highlighted in the job card that the supervisor made:\n\n1 – Engine would turn off automatically while changing the gear.\n2 – Wobbling in tyres, so asked them to rotate, balance and align all four tyres\n3 – One of the two horns not working.\n\nThere were few other small issues, which were attended, but the major ones mentioned above were left unattended. And for the stupid service, I paid an amount of more than Rs 9,000.\n\n1 – For engine turning off automatically, I was asked to change my batter, which I promptly did. The battery itself cost me Rs 9,000. However, the problem still persists. The engine still shuts down automatically while shifting gears occasionally. The frequency remains unchanged though.\n2 – I can bet a fortune that tyres were not even touched, forget rotation, balancing or alignment. Still I have been charged for it. The car still is as shaky as it was earlier.\n3 – They did manage to change the horn, but the new horn was even horrible. It sounded strange, as if something is stuck in it. I went to Motorcraft once again to get the horn fixed, but for this small thing, I had to wait for more than two hours. After that, they changed the horn (that’s what they say), but it still sounds the same.\n4 – Also, the washing of the car was not up to the mark.\n\nAfter having spent more than Rs 18,000 (Rs 9,000 for battery+Rs 9,00o for the disgusting service), I still remain unsatisfied. My car is still giving me the same troubles, as it was earlier.\n\nI am thoroughly upset with the kind of service Motorcraft provided me this time around. Even the staff has become more casual about everything. I feel it’s because of a Carnation service centre that has come up in the close vicinity, they employees of Motorcraft have become more callous, instead of improving their standards.\n\nI am 100% not going to Motorcraft ever again. If I am spending so much money, I will rather go to a place that gives me value, service and satisfaction.\n\nThanks.",
