            "text" : "Thanks Tajendar, because of your review I took my Skoda Octavia to Wheel Force Centre (BOSCH) and can easily say that it is no doubt better than a lot of authorized service stations I usually end up at. I also saw their review on the team bhp website.\nI was offered pick n drop service for my Skoda Octavia from South Delhi (Did not take it though, had to make sure what setup they had). \nThe service advisor at Wheel Force (BOSCH) – BCS workshop explained what was wrong with the car and even showed it on a computer screen which was interacting with the car. \nWhen I saw the service light switch off by just a click on a computer connected to my car through a wireless scanner, I was confident that I made the right decision. \nThat technology could speak to the car and it felt as if the car was telling the computer how every part is performing, which part needs to be changed and which can be used for another few thousand KMs. Simply amazing. The car feels like brand new once again at a price I always wished for. No more putting aside 10k – 15k for a service.\n\nCiao!!!",

I have been associated with Wheel Force Center for almost a decade and have had pleasant experiences of getting my various cars done up through the years . I have travelled the length and breath of the country due to my army service and had got my cars serviced from different service centers .... It is my considered opinion that Wheel Force Center has been one of the best . I really appreciate the zeal and enthusiasm of the management who are always looking to upgrade the technology .......In this quest they have tied up with Bosch and have installed state of the art service and body equipment .I take this opportunity to wish them all the luck in future .

            "text" : "Disappointed\nI had my car (Tata Indica) serviced from Bosch Service Station at Rajori Garden (Wheelforce) last week. Overall very poor response and I am saddened by the fact that even MNC like Bosch in India don’t have any dedicated focus on service quality. \nI went purely by reviews on the internet, found to be some kind of respite from usual dealers. \nI had requested for regular servicing apart from wheel alignment/balancing, car  wash & polishing, including cleaning of windows, headlight repair/replacement (as light was very dim in the night) if required and air-conditioner  servicing. Apart from AC and wheel job, everything else was completely dissatisfactory. Complete lack of understanding of customer request or sentiments.   This is on top of me checking and calling them up regularly with no one from the service center ever on his own contacted me for either checking or updating.  If this wasn’t enough, huge bill of Rs. 12,000/- with complete charges for everything but service. \nWouldn’t recommend anyone. Better to avoid and stick to the original service station. Apart from Bosch's name to attract gullible customers, nothing tangible or intangible in return from the said service station.",

Was taken aback by the high maintenance of my Chevy Optra(Auto Vikas). Visited “Wheel Force Centre” ( Rajouri Garden) through google, they fixed it. Was pleasantly surprised by this car service station. A well organized and efficiently personalized Service garage. To add to this, easy availability of original spares was an added boon. This enabled me to send my other two cars (Hyundai santro and Tata Safari) for Servicing. So the MULTIBRAND tag was worthwhile.",
