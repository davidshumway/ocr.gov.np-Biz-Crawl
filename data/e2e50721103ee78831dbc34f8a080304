            "text" : "In the Year 1999, when I was studying in Sun Shine School, Kurseong, I went for admission procedures, in five well respected schools, namely, Goethal's Memorial School, St. Joseph's School North Point, St. Anthony's School, Saint Augustine's School and St. Paul's School. Out of these five schools, I chose St. Paul's School. Mind you, I was just seven years old when I made that decision, so I didn't know about the high stature and respect the School held worldwide. I chose it because of primarily three reasons: 1. I was attarcted by the sublimity of the location and the infrastructure (which I'm sure any child of that age would be), 2. I was overwhelmed by the interaction between the teacher who took my admission test and me (Mr. Agnello Dennis), and lastly but most importantly 3. I felt at Home, I felt that connection between me and the school almost instantaneously. I still remember, that when I was selected for the Interview, I was so nervous that I whispered all the answers, to the questions that were asked to me by the then Rector (Rev. Fr. David Howard).\nI joined the school in the academic year 2000 in class 3. and i went on to study till class 12. The care,that the staff and the administrators take of the students, is exceptional and noteworthy. Discipline is one of the pillars of St.Paul's School,as it has always been. It is what defines us Paulites from others. Independence and Liberty can be found in any boarding School, but the righteous and judicious use of it, is taught in very few Institutions, St.Paul's School is one such Institution. The sense of responsibility isn't taught to someone, it arises from oneself, and I can assure you, it is one such minor quality in every Paulite.\nWhenever I think of my schooldays I only think of the time I spent in St.Paul's School. The vivid memories, still etched in my brain and it will never fade away. Along with education, the students are taught to lead an exceptional standard of life, but with humility. St.Paul's School has taught me the fundamentals between good and bad and to lead an exemplary life.\n\"Greatness is achieved by many, but a select few, have the indispensable quality of humility alongside it.\" \n                                                     Au Revoir.",
