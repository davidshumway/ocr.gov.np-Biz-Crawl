Rather she should have asked our opinion patiently and later could have kept her views or educated about the \"Act\" in a polite manner.\nSuch kind of behaviour made my patient  sicker as it aggravated her palpitation and anxiety level.\nSo we instead of taking further treatment left the cabin with lodging of verbal complaint with the outdoor Co-ordinator on duty.\nApart from this time management is ZERO\n\nManagement is requested to look into the matter and get back.",

No human touch, doctors lack compassion, nurses ill-treat patients, My father was badly treated when he was admitted there a couple of months ago. The doctor forced that we admit him, to perform few tests.He named such illness that really scared us and we promptly agreed to keep him in the hospital for 2 days. Random doctors were made to visit my father and give their so called expert comments.Finally , when my dad got discharged , all reports were normal.However, he came out in the worst of conditions, in lot of pain and poked everywhere wt injections and medications.A week later I lost my father. For me, it remains the Neotia Get WORSE Hospital.\nPlease Note:My resentment is towards a particular section /department of the Hospital and not the entire hospital.I have not dealt with the other departments , hence no comments on that.",
