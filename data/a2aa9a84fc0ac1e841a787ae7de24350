The rooms are comfortable and the food is good. Close to Thamel.\nEven when we returned from trekking unexpectedly early, they still managed to find rooms.\nIt is noisy at times at night (dogs in the street mostly), after all, this is Katmandu. but if you are looking for an affordable comfortable hotel with good staff in Katmandu, then you cannot get better than this. Free, fast WiFi and awesome food. The garden courtyard is a great place to unwind",
