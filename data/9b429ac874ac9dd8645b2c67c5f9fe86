It is located at 28\u00b040'0N 84\u00b01'0E with an altitude of. According to the preliminary result of the 2011 Nepal census it has a population of 6,527 people living in 1495 individual households. Its population density is 3 persons\/km2.It is situated on the broad valley of the Marshyangdi River to the north of the Annapurna mountain range. The river flows to the east. To the west there is the pass Thorong La to Muktinath shrine and the valley of the Kali Gandaki. To the north there is the Chulu East peak of 6,584 meters. Most groups trekking around the Annapurna will take resting days in Manang to acclimatize to the high altitude, before taking the Thorong La pass. The village is situated on the northern slope, which gets the most sunlight and the least snow cover in the winter. The cultivation fields are on the north slope with terraces.There are no roads, only trails where most heavy goods are transported on mule trains or carried by porters. 2.5 kilometers to the east of the town there is a small airport serving the whole valley. The airport is fairly recent. It did not exist in 1985. The development of a road linking Manang to the Annapurna conservation area was finished in February 2011. It has brought many benefits to the villagers and the area.Besides catering to the trekking groups there is some agriculture and herding activity (yaks). There is a medical centre which specializes in high-altitude sickness.","category_list":[{"id":"224455390913969","name":"City"}]},{"category":"Local business","id":"675451175854826","name":"Manang Himalayan Hotel","talking_about_count":1,"were_here_count":3,"location":{"street":"","city":"Nepal ","zip":"","latitude":28.6652752,"longitude":84.0249369},"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Manang-Himalayan-Hotel\/675451175854826","category_list":[{"id":"357899304273793","name":"Country"}]},{"category":"Local business","id":"118785968279894","name":"Hotel Himalayan Singi","likes":100,"talking_about_count":7,"were_here_count":13,"location":{"street":"Manang, Manang","zip":"977","latitude":28.6652566586,"longitude":84.0249437281},"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Hotel-Himalayan-Singi\/118785968279894","phone":"993664511","hours":{"mon_1_open":"06:00","mon_1_close":"21:00","tue_1_open":"06:00","tue_1_close":"21:00","wed_1_open":"06:00","wed_1_close":"21:00","thu_1_open":"06:00","thu_1_close":"21:00","fri_1_open":"06:00","fri_1_close":"21:00","sat_1_open":"06:00","sat_1_close":"21:00","sun_1_open":"06:00","sun_1_close":"21:00"},"category_list":[{"id":"164243073639257","name":"Hotel"},{"id":"144362285623268","name":"Food Stand"}],"cover":{"cover_id":"218380684987088","source":"https:\/\/scontent.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-xap1\/v\/t1.0-9\/1098401_218380684987088_487726567_n.jpg?oh=d61d74f0adb2026e374a0b4958887922&oe=55CDF15A","offset_y":86,"offset_x":0}},{"category":"City","id":"109272782432209","name":"Khangsar","likes":16,"talking_about_count":0,"were_here_count":65,"location":{"street":"","zip":"\u003C\u003Cnot-applicable>>","latitude":28.6833,"longitude":83.9833},"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Khangsar\/109272782432209","description":"Khangsar  is a village development committee in Manang District in the Gandaki Zone of northern Nepal.
