            "text" : "GREAT EXPERIENCE\n\nFrom december 26th 2014 to january 5th 2015, my wife, my 2 daughters (9 & 12 years old) and I had a 10 days trek in the Annapurna region with JOMSON TREK & EXPEDITION. \nGURU, the owner of this trekking company went with us during the trek.\nOur route was Dhampus, Landruk, Ghandruk, Jhinu, Chomrong, Chaile, Tadapani, Deurali, Gorepani, Ulleri, Birethanti.\nOur trek was fantastic. Guru and his staff (TEK the guide and DEWASH the porter) were perfect. They were all day long attentive. GURU was very professional and friendly. He really takes care of his staff and his customers (Each guide or porter is not allowed to carry more than 15 kilos). There is an excellent relationship between Guru and his staff and we could feel it all along the trek. \nGURU IS THE HUMANIST BOSS WHO THINKS THAT MONEY IS LESS IMPORTANT THAN THE RESPECT OF HUMAN DIGNITY.\n\nDEWASH was always smilling, singing and even sometime dancing traditional dances. His good mood was a great assitance for us and our daughters. He had a really good feeling with our children. Moreover, one evening I got a big pain to my Achilles heel, he made me an ayurvedic massage her mother had taught him years before and the morning after I felt really better. \nDEWASH IS THE GOOD MOOD FOLLOWING YOU ALL ALONG YOUR TREK.\n\nTEK was perfect with us. He teached lot of things about his country, the surrounding mountains, the culture and way of life of the people of Annapurna region. He really took care of us providing us every nights thick blankets for cold nights and supplying us bucket of hot water to wash ourselves when there was no hot running water any more in mountain’s accomodation (Tea Houses). Every time we asked for something that normally we can not obtain he succeeded in providing us what we want. \nTEK IS THE FRIENDLY GUIDE WHO CAN TEACH YOU LOT OF THINGS AND UNLOCK ALL SITUATIONS.\n\nTHIS TREK IS THE MOST POWERFUL EVENT WE LIVED IN OUR LIVES. IT IS A SOUVENIR WE WILL NEVER FORGET. THIS TREK WAS A SUCCESS BECAUSE OF GURU, TEK AND DEWASH. WE HAVE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT OURSELVES AND LIFE. GURU, TEK AND DEWASH WILL STAY FOR EVER IN OUR MINDS AND IN OUR HEARTS. THANK YOU GURU, TEK AND DIWASH FROM THE BOTTOM OF OUR HEARTS FOR THIS GREAT AND UNFORGETTABLE MOMENT.\n\nManuel Tavant\n\nNEW CALEDONIA\n\n",

            "text" : "New route Ghorepani / Poonhill Trek\nWe absolutely loved our trek through the Himalayas with Jomson Treks. Firstly, Mr. Guru was extremely helpful in organizing our hike and answered many of our questions quickly via email or in person once we arrived in Pokhara. Our knowledgeable guide, Shiva, was insightful and helpful. He showed us many places off the beaten track and always made sure that we were comfortable and happy. He was also very accommodating when we had to make changes to our route due to injury. He lead us new route from Kusma to Banau on the first day. We stayed with a local Nepalese family in the village and were treated with real Nepalese food and spectacular views of the Dhaulagiri Range & Annapurna Range. The next day we trekked to Phalamedanda where we again enjoyed beautiful views of both ranges and stayed with another very nice Nepalese family. The third day we trekked to Fulbari and were able to stay at a warm and cosy teahouse. From there we trekked to Poon Hill in the morning before pushing on through Ghorepani to a beautiful teahouse situated in the valley with views of the mountains. We also went to Ghandruk via the Rhodendron forest which was beautiful. From there we continued our trek through the valley and jungle until the end of our trek at Nayapul. Yes, we really love two option homestay and teahouse trek in this short period. We highly recommend Jomsom Treks for hiking in Nepal and look forward to our next experience with them.\nLarissa and Nathan\nAdelaide, Australia",

Guru was very professional from the start, he answered all of our questions via email and called me directly to confirm the final details. We started from Pokhara where Guru greeted us at the airport, and after a short meeting at his house, we headed to lakeside to visit and met our guide Arjun. We then went on to begin our trek in Kumsa. The first day we were in Banau, the second in Falamadada, the third in Fulbari. The daily treks enabled us to see beautiful views and stay in very welcoming guesthouses. We unfortunately had bad weather and decided to stay one day with our hosts in Fulbari and participated in the festival activities with them (tikka, sharing a meal, drinks and playing card games). Despite the ongoing poor weather conditions, the next day we headed out to Poonhill and Ghorepani. We stayed put in Ghorepani two days in hopes of catching a glimpse of the panoramic view! As the weather cleared up on our seventh day, we headed back down to Pokhara. \nWe would most definitely recommend the new route to climb up to Ghorepani. The only encounters we made were with people in the villages. And, the views and trails are amazing. \nWe would highly recommend Arjun. He had great suggestions when we were faced with difficult weather. He was also very patient and attentive. Conclusion: go with Guru and his team! And though this is the first trek we've done, we recommend this new route! ",

            "text" : "Guru from Jomsom Treks did an excellent job helping to arrange a 3 week long trekking journey to Upper Mustang and a portion of the Annapurna Circuit.  He was very professional from the start, quickly responding to our emails and discussing the different options for our route.  His company easily arranged all of our local transportation, including flights, cars, and arranged for all permits. Guru helped to set up our excellent guide, Ram Sing and our fabulous porter Tek.  When we encountered some transportation difficulties due to the monsoon, Guru, Ram and Tek helped to come up with alternative options and made sure that we still had a great adventure.  \n\nDuring our journey Ram and Tek were very professional and personable.  We had a great time learning from them about the local culture and geography, but also had a fun time telling stories and joking around as we trekked along.  Ram was excellent at helping to arrange accommodations in every village and arranging locals to show us around monasteries and caves.  Tek was very attentive all the time, helping with ordering and serving our meals, always offering to carry more gear, and making sure that I was safe when crossing a river or difficult section of the trail.  For example as we came down from Jomsom to Marpha, a section of the road was washed away due to flooding from the monsoon.  As we all searched to find a safe route to cross, Ram and Tek literally jumped into the rushing water to pull over large stones for me to cross over.   \n\nAs we met other tourists along our journey, we often talked about our experience with our trekking company and our guide and porter.  From every conversation we felt fortunate that we had the best guide and porter on the trail. Our guys acted as superlative translators, experts in lodging and food, and gave us constant assurance we were on the right trail and pace.  The whole experience was smooth and reassuring, almost verging on *too* easy!  Without jest, the help of our crew made our trip possible.  Every step was pleasant and never did we hear a single complaint or hasty word.  For every minute these guys were intensely patient and gracious, regardless of how often we stopped to take pictures or crawled up high-altitude trails as we slowly acclimatized. Clearly we were pleased; it would be hard to heap sufficient compliments on our crew.\n\nLastly it should be noted that we booked this trip rather last second.  The entire trip and all of the logistics, from selecting routes to getting permits to booking flights and lining up our faithful assistants, were setup with only 2 weeks notice prior to wheels-up to Nepal.  These guys are not the cheapest option around, but you get what you pay for and we got what seemed to be amongst the best, most experienced, and most capable crew on the circuit and in Mustang.\n\n",
