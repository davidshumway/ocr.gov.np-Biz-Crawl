            "text" : "Never Trust and go on this Bajaj Service Center \"Shree Automobiles Noida Sector 63\". These people are just cheating the customers. \n\nFirst they make a long bill after servicing of your bike.\nSecond Not a good behavior with customers.\n\nWhy am i frustrated with Shree Automobiles Noida?\n\nMy Bike is Pulser 135 (UP16 AA1956)\n\nOn Sat, 1st June 2013 i put my bike for servicing, My Bike was almost ok, It needs only servicing. After completing the servicing normally i take my bike and go to home. At home i checked the headlight of bike, it was not working. When i came to Shree Automobiles Bajaj Service Center, they told me that \"Bike aapko chorni padegi, Problem badi lag rahi hai.\" I scared to hear these words. Well i left my bike on that Bajaj Service Center and  back to my office. I went back to take my bike they replied me the wire plate is damaged you just need to change it. The cost of that plate they told (900 INR). Finally i returned at home and thought why i went to \"Shree Automobiles Bajaj Service Center\".\nMR.VINAY GARG is running a fraud Service Center of the brand Bajaj. I came here at this service center just because of the brand name“Bajaj”  \nI would suggest to all of my friends please don't go on this service center otherwise you will be the next.\n\nThanks\nBhupesh\n",
