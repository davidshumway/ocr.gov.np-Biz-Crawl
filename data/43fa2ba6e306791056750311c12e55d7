            "text" : "Location: By Taxi, about 10-15 minutes away from Thamel, depending on the traffic. It is near to the Narayanhiti Palace Museum. Although Thamel is within walking distance, it is not advisable as this is NOT a pleasant walking experience given the busy and dusty road. There's a mini market 2 minutes walking distance from the hotel and along the alley entering to the hotel, there are some souvenirs shops.\n\nTried the dinner ale-cart menu at The Fun Cafe (TFC), food was average, but costly for the small serving. Buffet breakfast at The Fun Cafe was OK too, good variety, some food is rather spicy probably due to Hindu/Indian influence.\n\nWe were given a room at the old wing, stayed for 2 nights and it was their very low season. The facilities were good, have hair dryer, a safe, iron and ironing board, come with 2 complementary bottles of water and complementary 24 hours of WIFI connection. The WIFI connection was weak although our room was just 1 room away from the router. No indication of power cut hours but there are power trips from time to time, I guess they equipped with generator. Room is clean, nicely decorated and has a 43 inches of flat screen TV, comfy bed.\n\nAll their staff are very friendly and very thoughtful. Service was good. \n\nOn a side note, suggest the hotel management should put some \"QUIET\" notice sign along the hallway. We were woke up few rounds by some Indian tenants that stay closed to our room during midnight. They were like having EXCITING GATHERING sessions in the hallway during midnight. It was 1am in the morning, please do your gathering sessions in day time!",
