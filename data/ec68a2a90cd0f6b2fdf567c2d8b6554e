Enquanto o complexo \u00e9 composto de pelo menos quatro pra\u00e7a distintas (pra\u00e7a Darbar, pra\u00e7a Taumadhi, pra\u00e7a Dattatreya e pra\u00e7a Olaria), o conjunto \u00e9 informalmente conhecido como o pra\u00e7a Darbar, sendo um local muito visitado no vale de Catmandu.Disposi\u00e7\u00e3oNa pra\u00e7a Durbar est\u00e1 localizado o antigo pal\u00e1cio real, com suas 55 janelas, que foi constru\u00eddo pelo rei Jitamitra Malla e foi a residencia da realeza at\u00e9 1769, sendo agora uma Museu Nacional, ele fica perto do Golden Gate, que conduz ao Templo Taleju. Este templo, como outros nas principais cidades do vale de Catmandu, \u00e9 dedicado \u00e0 deusa Taleju Bhawani e inclui santu\u00e1rios tanto a Bhawani Taleju como a Kumari.A entrada para o templo \u00e9 restrito para os hindus e \u00e9 expressamente proibido fotografar as est\u00e1tuas da deusa.As pra\u00e7as da pra\u00e7a Durbar s\u00e3o rodeadas por uma arquitetura espetacular e vividamente mostra as habilidades dos artistas e artes\u00e3os Neuaris\u200e ao longo de v\u00e1rios s\u00e9culos. O pal\u00e1cio real estava originalmente situado na pra\u00e7a Dattaraya e s\u00f3 mais tarde mudou-se para o atual lugar.Hist\u00f3riaA pra\u00e7a Darbar de Bhaktapur foi severamente danificada por um terremoto em 1934 e, portanto, parece mais espa\u00e7osa do que as outras localizadas em Catmandu e em Patan. Originalmente, havia 99 p\u00e1tios ligados a este lugar, mas agora apenas seis permanecem. Antes do terremoto, havia tr\u00eas grupos distintos de templos. Mas atualmente, o lugar em si \u00e9 cercada apenas por edif\u00edcios que sobreviveram ao terremoto.","category_list":[{"id":"209889829023118","name":"Landmark"}]},{"category":"Local business","id":"188985261235639","name":"Bhaktapur, Nepal","likes":329,"talking_about_count":666,"were_here_count":8057,"location":{"street":"","city":"Kathmandu","country":"Nepal","zip":"","latitude":27.671084658043,"longitude":85.429173343635},"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Bhaktapur-Nepal\/188985261235639","category_list":[{"id":"224455390913969","name":"City"}]},{"category":"Local business","id":"332122426876709","name":"Baktapur","likes":58,"talking_about_count":276,"were_here_count":2264,"location":{"street":"","city":"Bhaktapur","country":"Nepal","zip":"","latitude":27.670274149187,"longitude":85.428271631238},"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Baktapur\/332122426876709","website":"\u003C\u003Cnot-applicable>>","category_list":[{"id":"2500","name":"Local Business"}]},{"category":"Local business","id":"131315303639802","name":"Nyatapola Square","likes":312,"talking_about_count":54,"were_here_count":4895,"location":{"street":"","city":"Bhaktapur","country":"Nepal","zip":"","latitude":27.671163297243,"longitude":85.42921738881},"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Nyatapola-Square\/131315303639802","website":"www.itreknepal.com","category_list":[{"id":"197097220301977","name":"Historical Place"},{"id":"110207655727714","name":"Public Square"},{"id":"186825111351005","name":"Tourist Attraction"}]},{"category":"Local business","id":"183023481886533","name":"Somewhere Under Sky","likes":552,"talking_about_count":1012,"were_here_count":24043,"location":{"street":"","city":"Bhaktapur","country":"Nepal","zip":"","latitude":27.6711517875,"longitude":85.4283751323},"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Somewhere-Under-Sky\/183023481886533","category_list":[{"id":"272705352802676","name":"Outdoors"},{"id":"192049437499122","name":"Residence &amp; Other"}]},{"category":"City","id":"107541015941651","name":"Bhaktapur","likes":52604,"talking_about_count":2498,"were_here_count":126088,"location":{"street":"","zip":"44800","latitude":27.6667,"longitude":85.4167},"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Bhaktapur\/107541015941651","description":"Bhaktapur, literally translates to Place of devotees. Also known as Bhadgaon or Khwopa, it is an ancient Newar city in the east corner of the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal, about from the capital city, Kathmandu. It is located in Bhaktapur District in the Bagmati Zone.Bhaktapur was the largest of the three Newar kingdoms of the Kathmandu Valley, and was the capital of Nepal during the great 'Malla Kingdom' until the second half of the 15th century. Today it is the third largest city in the Kathmandu Valley, with a population of more than 80,000, of which the vast majority are still Newars. Historically more isolated than the other two kingdoms, Kathmandu and Patan, Bhaktapur has a distinctly different form of Nepal Bhasa language.Bhaktapur has the best preserved palace courtyards and old city center in Nepal, and is listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO for its rich culture, temples, and wood, metal and stone artworks. This is supported by the restoration and preservation efforts of German-funded Bhaktapur Development Project (BDP).The city is famous for special type of curd called \"Ju Ju(king) dhau(curd). It is experienced by the curd makers that the taste of curd prepared in this location cannot be found elsewhere all over Nepal.EtymologyKHWOPA is the ancient name of Bhaktapur. The term \"Bhaktapur\" (Sanskrit\/Nepali: \u092d\u0915\u094d\u0924\u092a\u0941\u0930) refers to \"The City Of Devotees\". This Bhaktapur City is also known as \"Khwopa\" (Nepal Bhasa: \u0916\u094d\u0935\u092a) or \"Bhadgaon\" (Nepali:\u092d\u093e\u0926\u0917\u093e\u0901\u0909) or \"Ancient Newari Town\" throughout the Kathmandu Valley. \"Kh0apa\" actually refers to the masks which are believed to have been worn by gods and goddesses. Bhaktapur is popular for different forms of mask dances based on lives of different deities and therefore, it was named \"Khwapa\" which later came to become just \"Khwopa,\" which is also near to meaning masks.","category_list":[{"id":"2401","name":"City"}]},{"category":"Public places","id":"180820158640001","name":"Taumadhi (Ta:maari) \u0924\u0903\u092e\u093e\u0930\u0940","likes":2537,"talking_about_count":25,"were_here_count":5514,"location":{"street":"Ta:maari","city":"Bhaktapur","country":"Nepal","zip":"Taumadhi","latitude":27.671113434121,"longitude":85.429300362},"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/taumadhi","phone":"Phone","website":"Website","description":"The Nyataponla Temple presides over the Taumadhi Square.

The struts, doors, windows and tympanums\u2014each embellished with attractively carved divine figures\u2014perfectly portray the creative tradition of Newar craftsmen. The temple is dedicated to Goddess Siddhi Laxmi, the manifestation of female force and creativity. The latest major renovation of this monument was carried out in 1997 AD by Bhaktapur Municipality using the revenue it collected from tourists.\n\nNext to the Nyataponla Temple is the rectangular shaped Bhairavnath Temple. It houses a gilded bust of Bhairav, the ferocious manifestation of Lord Shiva. The three-storied pagoda was razed to the grounds by the 1934-earthquake, and its latest renovation was undertaken by Bhaktapur Municipality in 1995 AD.\n\nThe enclosed complex facing the Nyataponla Temple is dedicated to Tilmadhav Narayan, a manifestation of Lord Vishnu, who is one of the Supreme Triumvirate of Hindu pantheon. A few steps ahead it, to the southwest, lies the famous Pottery Square, where visitors can see the city\u2019s well-known potters making variously shaped and sized earthenware. The major monumental highlight of this square is a temple of Jeth Ganesh, which dates back to the 14th century.\n","category_list":[{"id":"276651312419490","name":"Monument"},{"id":"197097220301977","name":"Historical Place"},{"id":"186825111351005","name":"Tourist

It is recognized as a home of medieval art and architecture. It has religious, historical and natural significance.\n               Bhaktapur city was founded by King Anand Dev in 889 AD (MoIC, 2000). It is about 15 km east of Kathmandu and is spread over an area of about 5 sq. kms, at an elevation of 1401 masl.\t Foreign scholars and historians have praised the city as a museum of ancient art and architecture of the Newar community. Impressed by the art and architecture, Moran (1996) wrote, \"The city remains a superb example of the Newars' instinctive mastery of urban planning. Despite an urban population density exceeding that of Tokyo or New York, Bhaktapur feels remarkably uncrowded and orderly. Thanks to the masterful structuring of urban space.  \n\nBhaktapur city is one of the best models of sustainability in the world. From the agricultural inputs to the daily consumable goods (like clothing, food and building materials), the society in Bhaktapur was self sufficient and very sustainable.\nIn the spirit of sustainability and preserving the culture of this beautiful city, Thagu Chhen was conceptualized. It was a small piece of ancestral land of the Pradhanang family whose roots are from Bhaktapur. It was initiated to set an example of preserving culture with commercial viability and sustainability, which could then be replicated and propogated in a bigger way to make Bhaktapur a better and prosperous place.\n\nThe building is a perfect example of a modern building combining traditional influences. The exposed brick fa\u00e7ade meant, there was no need to paint the walls, which add an earthiness and russet warmth to the house. The fa\u00e7ade has been designed to give the look which reflects symmetry and balance. The building tends to commercialize by means of total four apartment suites. These apartment suites aim to deliver some quality living spaces. The design is such that, there is a feeling of smooth flux within inner and outer spaces. The main concept of the design was to penetrate light into the building avoiding passages and providing open spaces and balconies for improved light and ventilation. The wide panels of glass in the northern side, separating the outer spaces with the inner one, connect them visually. The northern side provides a panoramic view of the Himalayan range from a dropdown height of approximately forty feet from the ground level of the house.\nThe house is not opulent , but exudes elegant simplicity. Whatever decorations are there, they have been inbuilt into the construction. There are no extra design features, be it the strategically placed niches, \u2018thams\u2019 (decorative wooden pillars) or the domical alcove in the ground floor. All the living quarters face south, to catch the winter sun and traditional skirt roof shields the windows from the slanting rain. The kitchens and bathrooms are bright and elegantly simple, and furnished with all the modern amenities. The floor is done in local \u2018telia\u2019 tiles which provide not just good insulation, but also give an earthy traditional feel. The visual association between the living, dining and kitchen has an impression of modernized living spaces, yet the interior depicts plenty of elements from Newari architecture that blends the difference between the two. \nThe material usages also in the building have its influences from the Newari architectural style. The wooden carvings, the exposed brickwork, the classical traditional niches, the wooden staircases and the intricately carved windows and \u2018Thams\u2019, all try to conserve and preserve the Newari culture by their mere presence. Moreover, all the bricks used in the house are reclaimed bricks collected from old dilapidated houses which were centuries old. Even the intricately carved wooden pillars called \u2018Tham\u2019 and the big central window called \u2018San jhya:\u2019 which is approximately two centuries old, are reclaimed from dismantled houses from different parts of the valley.\nThe topmost level houses a laundry space for the inhabitants along with a small apartment suite. There are two levels of terraces which provide a resting space as well as a breathtaking 3600 view of the Bhaktapur city.\nSUSTAINABLE FEATURES USED IN THE BUILDING\n\u201c REDUCE , REUSE and RECYCLE\u201d This is the main theme with which Thagu chhen  has been designed.\nMANPOWER EFFICIENCY:\nThe hotel industry is notorious for hiring outsiders in almost every country in the world, but one factor that contributes to a hotel\u2019s sustainability rating is their use of local labor. The more a hotel hires from the indigenous population, the more it is contributing to the local economy and making it more self sufficient. Thagu Chhen is proud to have local staffs for serving the guests and giving the essence of Newari culture of this ancient city of Bhaktapur.\nMATERIAL EFFICIENCY:\nLocally sourced and manufactured materials like \u2018telia\u2019 bricks, wooden carvings from Bhaktapur save a lot of embodied energy used in the manufacturing, shipping and packaging of products.\nNot only that, use of reclaimed bricks, wooden carved pillars and windows, has lowered the amount of resources needed to produce these materials.\nGlass, metal, steel, aluminum, bricks, wood, etc being green materials, are easy to reuse and recycle over and over again without losing any quality. Thus, usage of these same materials along with reclaimed bricks, pillars and windows, recycled furniture, cushions and straw mats and local \u2018telia\u2019 bricks, \u2018dachi apa\u2019 bricks and \u2018Jhingati\u2019 tiles have made the house more material efficient.\n\nENERGY EFFICIENCY:\nLighting is provided through the use of LED (Light Emitting Diodes) & CFLs (Compact Fluorescent Lamps) which are very energy efficient. The windows and the roof overhangs have been oriented as such to shade windows during the summer while maximizing solar gain in the winter. In addition, effective window placement (day lighting) in the northern side provides more natural light and lessens the need for electric lighting during the day. Solar water heating further ensures twenty four hours of hot water supply and reduces energy costs.\nWATER  EFFICIENCY:\nRainwater harvesting is done by channeling roof water precipitation into an underground tank at site which is then filtered via a bio-sand filtration before being used at the house.\nThe wastewater treatment plant has also been designed so that the waste water (grey water) can be recycled and reused as well. Thus, the only water that flows out of the house is the one that is flushed out from the cistern. Rest of the water is recycled inside the house reducing the amount of water consumption.\nAll in all, this is a small initiation from the Pradhanang family to preserve and showcase Newari culture and architecture, while also being very sustainable and functional in the modern sense.  \n\n","hours":{"mon_1_open":"07:00","mon_1_close":"21:00","tue_1_open":"07:00","tue_1_close":"21:00","wed_1_open":"07:00","wed_1_close":"21:00","thu_1_open":"07:00","thu_1_close":"21:00","fri_1_open":"07:00","fri_1_close":"21:00","sat_1_open":"07:00","sat_1_close":"21:00","sun_1_open":"07:00","sun_1_close":"21:00"},"category_list":[{"id":"181216025249367","name":"Apartment &amp;

It is affiliated to Pokhara University. nec received Nepal's best engineering college award in 2014 presented by Oxford summit of leaders, London.HistoryNepal Engineering College was established in 1994 as a non profit institution under private sector initiative. The foundation of nec was laid by few visionary Nepalese professionals and academicians who realized the need of an institution serving the technical education needs of the country for accelerated economic growth, reaching to wider section of Nepalese students and making the quality technical education accessible and affordable to the masses. This pioneering example set by nec led to the establishment of a number of engineering colleges in the country in the private sector in the later years. It is one and only engineering college in Nepal with an ISO standard certificate. Also, the visionaries had an adapt knowledge of the easy money that could be churned out of the education industry in this country. Henceforth they came up with an idea of an engineering college in an isolated area. nec meets all the standard of a complete engineering college and its products are well scattered in the market as very competent employees in some reputed organisations, many of the students from nec are pursuing master's and PhD colleges abroad like USA, Australia and Europe as well. The Chairman of nec Mr. Lambodar Neupane was awarded with \"Manager of the year\" by Oxford summit of leaders, London.","category_list":[{"id":"108051929285833","name":"College &amp;

literally translates to Place of devotees. Also known as Bhadgaon or Khwopa, it is an ancient Newar city in the east corner of the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal, about from the capital city, Kathmandu. It is located in Bhaktapur District in the Bagmati Zone.Bhaktapur was the largest of the three Newar kingdoms of the Kathmandu Valley, and was the capital of Nepal during the great 'Malla Kingdom' until the second half of the 15th century. Today it is the third largest city in the Kathmandu Valley, with a population of more than 80,000, of which the vast majority are still Newars. Historically more isolated than the other two kingdoms, Kathmandu and Patan, Bhaktapur has a distinctly different form of Nepal Bhasa language.Bhaktapur has the best preserved palace courtyards and old city center in Nepal, and is listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO for its rich culture, temples, and wood, metal and stone artworks. This is supported by the restoration and preservation efforts of German-funded Bhaktapur Development Project (BDP).The city is famous for special type of curd called \"Ju Ju(king) dhau(curd). It is experienced by the curd makers that the taste of curd prepared in this location cannot be found elsewhere all over Nepal.EtymologyKHWOPA is the ancient name of Bhaktapur. The term \"Bhaktapur\" (Sanskrit\/Nepali: \u092d\u0915\u094d\u0924\u092a\u0941\u0930) refers to \"The City Of Devotees\". This Bhaktapur City is also known as \"Khwopa\" (Nepal Bhasa: \u0916\u094d\u0935\u092a) or \"Bhadgaon\" (Nepali:\u092d\u093e\u0926\u0917\u093e\u0901\u0909) or \"Ancient Newari Town\" throughout the Kathmandu Valley. \"Kh0apa\" actually refers to the masks which are believed to have been worn by gods and goddesses. Bhaktapur is popular for different forms of mask dances based on lives of different deities and therefore, it was named \"Khwapa\" which later came to become just \"Khwopa,\" which is also near to meaning masks.","category_list":[{"id":"224455390913969","name":"City"}]},{"category":"Local business","id":"208922722472447","name":"Panauti Kushadevi","likes":56,"talking_about_count":7,"were_here_count":425,"location":{"street":"","zip":"","latitude":27.6479535829,"longitude":85.4651909085},"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Panauti-Kushadevi\/208922722472447","category_list":[{"id":"2500","name":"Local Business"}]},{"category":"Local business","id":"394733690549439","name":"Cloud 9 Restaurant With Garden","likes":39,"talking_about_count":0,"were_here_count":848,"location":{"street":"","city":"Bhaktapur","country":"Nepal","zip":"","latitude":27.671326403718,"longitude":85.427988106982},"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Cloud-9-Restaurant-With-Garden\/394733690549439","phone":"016612370","category_list":[{"id":"273819889375819","name":"Restaurant"}]},{"category":"Business services","id":"463126523721310","name":"FrNs CaFe GuYzz","likes":174,"talking_about_count":0,"were_here_count":97,"location":{"street":"","city":"Bhatgaon","country":"Nepal","zip":"+977","latitude":27.66508815,"longitude":85.429641165},"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/FrNs-CaFe-GuYzz\/463126523721310","phone":"9808627443   n   9860025402","website":"http:\/\/www.donzibishal.blogspot.com","description":"In our cafe you can enjoy our impressive services.

It is considered as the heart of Kathmandu city. As it leads to the former Royal Palace of Narayanhiti, Durbar Marg is also known as King's way among foreigners. It is a famous tourist area after Thamel. Durbar Marg is a posh area of Kathmandu with luxury hotels, restaurants serving international cuisines, pricey boutiques, travel agencies and airline offices.\n\nA statue of King Mahendra, father of King Birendra stands in the center of the roundabout at the junction of Durbarmarg with Jamal. The ancient settlement of Jamal was a victim of the Ranas' enthusiasm for building. The rulers seized land from farmers and monasteries, demolishing an old bahal to make way for the new road. The bahal, one time abode of the White (Sveta) Matsyendranath, stood where the god's image had been found in a field, an event commemorated every year at the Jana Baha Dyah Jatra. Sveta Matsyendranath's chariot is assembled and driven three times round the spot over which the statue of King Mahendra now presides. Also on Durbar Marg, the greater part of which was built during the Rana era, are the campus of Tri-Chandra College and a mosque used by the valley's Muslim minority.\nRecently, the Royal Palace was turned into a public museum immediately after the country was declared a republic. Few years back there has been a recent upsurge in the construction activities in the region. Durbarmarg is a central junction for the road connecting Lazimpat and Thamel, Bhat-Bhateni and Baluwatar, New Road and Asan and Putali Sadak and Kamaladi. Durbar Marg is one of the most well maintained and cleanest places in the Kathmandu valley, and a green belt has been created in the side way. Narayanhity Palace Museum, luxury hotels, shopping malls, discos, pubs and famous branded showroom's have been a special feature of Durbar Marg.","category_list":[{"id":"209889829023118","name":"Landmark"},{"id":"151810238222781","name":"Street"},{"id":"136412456432179","name":"Shopping District"}],"cover":{"cover_id":"216436098529301","source":"https:\/\/scontent.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-xfp1\/v\/t1.0-9\/s720x720\/1425760_216436098529301_101025880_n.jpg?oh=82dd5942887f61a97cfeb45db5ea72d6&oe=55DA37A1","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}},{"category":"Public places","id":"350840058405981","name":"Ananta Lingeshwar Mahadev Temple","likes":369,"talking_about_count":19,"were_here_count":179,"location":{"street":"Dadhikot 4, Bhaktapur","city":"Bhaktapur","country":"Nepal","zip":"00977","latitude":27.6667,"longitude":85.4167},"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/anantalingeshwarmahadev","category_list":[{"id":"587075671302634","name":"Hindu Temple"}],"cover":{"cover_id":"350844255072228","source":"https:\/\/scontent.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-xat1\/t31.0-8\/s720x720\/10271219_350844255072228_6674829966953482280_o.jpg","offset_y":23,"offset_x":0}},{"category":"Non-governmental organization (ngo)","id":"115284071895565","name":"Siddhi Memorial Foundation","likes":353,"talking_about_count":86,"were_here_count":49,"location":{"street":"PO Box 40, Bhimsensthan","city":"Bhaktapur","country":"Nepal","zip":"","latitude":27.6667,"longitude":85.4167},"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/SiddhiMemorialFoundation","phone":"00977-1-6616589\/6612945","website":"www.smf.org.np","description":"In lasting memory of their son Siddhi Sundar Dhaubhadel, who died in a road accident on the 8th of October 1993, Mr. Shyam S. Dhaubhadel and Mrs. Ranjana Dhaubhadel founded the Siddhi Memorial Health Service Centre (SMHSC) on the 28th of October 1993 at Barahisthan, Bhaktapur Municipality-14. This non-governmental and non-profit clinic provided primary health care services to needy women and children under the guiding principle of \u201cService to Humanity\u201d. Today there is an ongoing Saturday morning clinic held at the SMHSC, addressing the ever-increasing demand of Family Planning and Immunization in this region, as well as providing pre-natal and post-natal care and general checkups.\n\nThe growing demand of the centre encouraged the founders to expand its health services, and to establish a hospital for women and children. An initial commitment towards sponsorship was made by the founders in the form of a contribution of land. This totaled an area of 4000 square meters, located at the mid-southern periphery of Bhaktapur City at Bhimsensthan, Bhaktapur -7.\n\nOn the 1st January 1998, Siddhi Memorial Hospital (SMH) construction was opened. The Outpatient Department (OPD), providing OPD care for women and children.\n\nIn 2003 the Siddhi Memorial Foundation (SMF) was established, merging the SMHSC into the SMF. At this time the organization branched into public health with its first HIV\/AIDS Harm Reduction Program. SMF now conducts two harm reduction programs funded by UNODC.\n\nOn the 22nd October 2005, we opened the Siddhi Shaligram Briddhashram (SSB). The mission of SSB is to help elderly people live peaceful, fulfilling and happy lives. SSB aims to offer support and services to all elderly persons, irrespective of status, wealth, caste, religion, relationship, gender or ethnicity.","mission":"To serve people especially children, women and elderly in need and strengthen art, culture, and education of people in Bhaktapur, thereby helping them to grow with dignity as capable and contributing members of the society.","category_list":[{"id":"228143393877753","name":"Medical Center"},{"id":"151676848220295","name":"Education"}],"cover":{"cover_id":"788373837919915","source":"https:\/\/scontent.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-xpf1\/t31.0-8\/s720x720\/10453036_788373837919915_5248744441348751722_o.png","offset_y":16,"offset_x":0},"founded":"1993"},{"category":"Local business","id":"438782836203955","name":"Gamcha, Dadhikot","likes":38,"talking_about_count":15,"were_here_count":969,"location":{"street":"","city":"Bhaktapur","country":"Nepal","zip":"","latitude":27.6603832229,"longitude":85.3908049563},"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Gamcha-Dadhikot\/438782836203955","category_list":[{"id":"188662441155211","name":"Community &amp; Government"}]},{"category":"Organization","id":"334196886681210","name":"Human Organ Transplant Center, Nepal","likes":3214,"talking_about_count":107,"were_here_count":0,"location":{"street":"Bhaktapur","city":"Bhaktapur","country":"Nepal","zip":"","latitude":27.672776546098,"longitude":85.421791873533},"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/hotc.nepal","phone":"+977-1-6614709, 6614656","website":"www.hotc.org.np","description":"Health care has been one of the most challenging issues for Nepal that is further compounded by its geo-political and social circumstances. The government of Nepal is serious about this issue and thus has invested maximum effort and resources in order to develop new facilities to enhance the existing health services. Nepal has made a significant progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), particularly in the health sector.\n\nAn estimated figure shows that about 3000 people develop kidney failure every year in Nepal where as an incidence of liver failure is 1,000 every year. Similarly the estimated diabetic population who might be benefited from pancreas transplantation in Nepal is 30\u0025 of the 10 Lac diabetics. There is no data of heart or lung failure in the country yet.\n\nThe incidence of end stage renal disease (ESRD) is rising worldwide. It is an important cause of high mortality and morbidity and the treatment of ESRD is costly. More than 90\u0025 of ESRD population dies within few months in South Asia. Out of this 3000, only around 25-30\u0025 patients can reach the hospitals with dialysis facilities.\n\nThe estimated cost of haemodialysis is NRs. 8,322 ($ 114) \/ month in Bir hospital and NRs. 16644 ($228) \/ month in NGOs and private sectors. The cost of renal transplant is upto $ 25000 in India depending whereas it costs around NRs. 500000 ($7000) at Bir hospital.\n\nAt present, only a small number of Kidney failure patients have benefited from the kidney transplant programme in the country as large numbers of such patients are still going to neighboring India or other countries for various reasons. More importantly, the access of Nepali patients with liver failure, diabetes, heart or lung failure to the respective organ transplantation has been a big challenge and probably impossible for most of our people.\n\nThere is no facility for liver, pancreas, bone marrow, heart or lung transplantation in the country yet. So, to establish an ultramodern center for nephrology, urology, and kidney transplantation, hepato-biliary, pancreatic diseases and liver \/ pancreas transplantation, bone marrow and heart or lung transplantation at an affordable cost and to save millions of rupees that is drained out every year in the treatment of such organs in the neighboring countries. It will also avoid the harassment and hassle the patients and the family have to face during their stay in the foreign countries.\n\nThe government of Nepal decided to develop a modern \u201cHuman Organ Transplant Center HOTC\u201d, on 12th Aswin, 2067 (28th Sept 2010) in the new building of Bhaktapur hospital to help its citizens with organ failures to sustain quality lives and improve their life expectancy with immediate availability of facilities for the treatment of kidney diseases including dialysis, urology, nephrology and transplantation.\n\nThe ministry of Health and Population (MOHP) under the leadership of Minister Uma Kanta Chowdhary and Secretary Prof. Dr, Praveen Mishra formed a high level committee with Prof. Dr. Vijay Kumar Sharma,NAMS, Bir hospital as chairman on 20th Poush, 2067 (4th January, 2011) to submit a study report to establish the center.

Both of them know how it feels to lose their father as a child. So for them it felt natural to help orphan children and they established the orphan home in Sipadol.\n\nAt the moment there are 20 children living in Bhaktapur orphan home. They have their own house. Beside children\u2019s bedrooms there is a kitchen, two bathrooms (one in each floor), a playing and studying room, office and roof top terrace.\n\nWe want to be as self-sustaining as possible at the orphan home and step by step moving towards this goal. We grow our own vegetables (cabbage, potatoes, pumpkins, spinach, onions, chilies etc.) and it helps us to reduce our expenses for food a lot (we save about 450000 NPR (4000 EUR) per year). Part of land we own, part \u2013 we rent.\n\nWe also have one young female buffalo, which in the future will be providing milk for our children. In the same animal house we raise several goats and about 100 chickens.\n\nChildren also get involved in gardening and farming activities, because we believe this helps them to get skills which children usually get growing in families.\n\nIn 2012 we also started a goat farm about 1,5 hour drive from Sipadol. Now we have just 30 goats, but in the future we hope to increase this number and sell goat meat. This would help us to generate sustainable income.\n\nBesides that, our children shower with hot water and we heat it in environmentally friendly way \u2013 with solar battery.\n\nAll our children attend a private English school (Gundu secondary school). After school, they also get help with their homework from a professional  teacher. Shakhar k.c. comes regularly to teach them.\n\nMost of our children lost both of their parents. There are several who have fathers, but they don\u2019t take care of them. Also there are 3 women looking after our children (cooking, cleaning etc.) and their children live together in our orphan home, because their fathers died.\n\nIn a future we would like to expand number of our children to 50. But for that we need more space \u2013 to build one more floor of the house.\n\nWe don\u2019t get any financial support from any governmental institution of Nepal. Bhaktapur orphan home is supported by several good people and businesses from all over the world; also we are supported by organization \u201cHands with hands\u201d. The rest \u2013 comes from Ryia\u2019s and Rupak\u2019s families and Rupak\u2019s business, which he runs together with his business partner.","mission":"Helping orphan kids for Education & how to get  independent life  for their future.","general_info":"Bhaktapur self-Sustaining orphan home ,\n20 Orphan children are living with us from different districts from Nepal. \nit is located in Central Nepal .

Uttam Sanjel, powerhouse of altruistic energy with unselfish regard and devotion to the welfare of the society, had come up with an idea with Bamboo school that has the lowest infrastructural costs. He calls his schools Samata Shiksha Niketan, 'places of study and peace\u2019. Samata School charges a fee of Rs 100 per month for all the grades from nursery to Class 10. This fee has been in constant since its establishment on 2001. Samata School has now been expanded into 11 different locations within 8 district, Kathmandu, Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, Kavreplanchowk, Sindhupalchowk, Chitwan, Nawalparasi, and Makawanpur. Last year only, 11 students from the first batch appear on the SLC board, all of them graduated with first division mark with a minimum of 75\u0025 marks. Samata School currently has 16000 students. \n\nIf you want to contribute for this school, you can directly contact Uttam Sanjel, at his cell phone, +9779851071468 . Try once, if you share something to a person who has less than what you have, I am sure you will get the pleasure of sharing...\n\nSamata School - Kathmandu, Nepal\n\n\nDespite its natural beauty, spirituality and rich culture, Nepal is one of the most economically poor countries in the world.\nAround one and a half million people live in the bustling capital, with thousands more residing in the surrounding villages and mountain hamlets, where life is especially difficult.\nHere, the majority of the population rely on subsistence farming or try to earn a living from tourism or weaving, but machine-made goods and poor harvests have significantly limited their prospects.\nConsequently some families send their children to live with other families in the city, their household chores or factory work paying for bed and board.\nMany such children attend Samata School in the centre of Kathmandu. Because of their domestic or factory labour duties there are usually only around half of the students \u2013 1,500 \u2013 in school at any one time.\nLots of Samata's students are orphans or have been separated from their families during political upheaval; for them school is home and their only chance of gaining an education and social skills. Others rely on Samata to provide basic medical care and a meagre lunch, which usually amounts to just a handful of rice.\nFounded and run by a young, visionary philanthropist, the present school was built from scratch when it had to be moved two years ago. There are now rudimentary bamboo-and-plaster classrooms, as well as very basic sanitation and kitchen facilities.\nAlthough the school provides a safe and harmonious environment for the children, conditions are dark and cramped and the aim is to improve the site as more money becomes available.\nLessons at the school are conducted in English and concentrate on a thorough learning of the language, which is the most important education a Nepalese child can have. Without it they cannot take public exams or apply for a job in tourism or communications.\nThe school also pays special attention to the spiritual development of its pupils, giving a sound education of Nepal, the country's needs, the importance of honesty, peace and caring for others.\nAs such, many of the children have a desire to become doctors, nurses, social workers and teachers, so that they can make their own contribution to society and repay the debt they feel they owe for their education.\n\nUttam Sanjel\n\nAbout Uttam Sanjel\n\nUttam Sanjel is a 35 year old man born in Nepal. When he was 25 years of age, he had gone to Mumbai India to make a successful career on Bollywood Film Industry; there he spent 3 years of his life struggling for success. When he was living in Mumbai, he happened to see something terrible about street children on the streets of Mumbai and train station platforms and realized that real heroes of our world are not famous movie stars but people like Mahatma Gandhi and Mother Teresa who perform great jobs for the welfare of society.\n\nThis realization inspired him to come back to Nepal and work for needy and poor children and came up with an idea with building Schools from Bamboo\u2019s that has the lowest infrastructural costs. Bamboos are inexpensive; strong, earthquake proof and very easy to find as well. Use of bamboos lowers the construction cost by 60\u0025. He calls his school as Samata Shiksha Niketan which means, \u201cA place for study and peace\u201d. Uttam Sanjel is a powerhouse of altruistic energy. He has no selfish regards regarding his works; he is very optimistic and devoted towards his work from his heart for the welfare of the society.\nAbout His Work\n\nSamata Shiksha Niketan\n\nSamata Shiksha Niketan was established on 2001. It charges a fee of Rs 100 per month for all the grades from Nursery to Class 10. This fee has been in constant since its establishment. The School has now been expanded into 11 different locations within 8 districts of Nepal such as Kathmandu, Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, Kavre Palanchowk, Sindhu Palchowk, Chitwan, Nawalparasi, and Makwanpur. Last year only, 11 students from the first batch had appeared on the SLC Board Exam and all of them graduated with first division mark with a minimum of 75\u0025 and some of his graduates have gone to higher education. The school currently has 16000 students.\n\nWhen Uttam Sanjel built his first school he had asked his neighboring families to donate at least one piece of bamboo each. In Nepal, girls are often considered inferior to boys and not worthy of an education but Uttam Sanjel denies the fact and not ready to accept it, so at the bamboo schools he builds, the enrollment is higher for girls than boys. His ultimate goal is to build 75 schools one in each district of Nepal.\n\nIn an interview, Uttam says that, \u201cIf I were married, I would have only a couple of children. I have 15,000. What could be better? \u201c Uttam\u2019s motto is, \u201cTo rest is to rust\u201d and what he tells to his students is that, \u201cIn some schools in the world, children are taught to become human bombs. Here I want you to become peace bombs in the village, in your family and in society\u201d.\n\nContact Info:\n\nUttam Sanjel\n\nPhone No: +977-9851071468\n","mission":"Education+Equity+Empowerment+Equality+Understanding+Unity+Sustainable Development+Respect+Religious Tolerance+Plurality=Peace","category_list":[{"id":"176831012360626","name":"Professional Services"}],"cover":{"cover_id":"541595405859072","source":"https:\/\/fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net\/hphotos-ak-xfa1\/v\/t1.0-9\/s720x720\/735011_541595405859072_93025422_n.jpg?oh=01e6f424c6ae96b387de9537410b0aeb&oe=55DE228A&__gda__=1439308641_ab08319529b746844da0556f80870909","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"founded":" 2001"},{"category":"School","id":"324164454399213","name":"Sunshine National School","likes":303,"talking_about_count":9,"were_here_count":59,"location":{"street":"","city":"Bhaktapur","country":"Nepal","zip":"","latitude":27.66763019,"longitude":85.42490589},"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/snschool6614835","phone":"01-6614835","website":"http:\/\/www.snschool.edu.np","category_list":[{"id":"365182493518892","name":"School"}],"cover":{"cover_id":"324169397732052","source":"https:\/\/scontent.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-xpa1\/t31.0-8\/p180x540\/10359045_324169397732052_91429302603999102_o.jpg","offset_y":52,"offset_x":0},"founded":"Mrs. Neeru Dhakal"},{"category":"Pet services","id":"165872823489805","name":"Vet for Your Pet- the Animals' Clinic","likes":1256,"talking_about_count":3,"were_here_count":27,"location":{"street":"","city":"Bhaktapur","country":"Nepal","zip":"+977","latitude":27.666295823112,"longitude":85.425871452074},"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/vetforyourpet","phone":"01-6613244","website":"Website","description":"Vet For Your Pet- the Animals' Clinic is a full service facility offering advanced medical and surgical clinic.

Our Multiculturalism has made Bhaktapur a Gastronomical paradise and home to hundreds of Spectacular temples and colourful festivals (It is also said that we have more temples than houses, more festivals than a days in a year and more god and goddesses than people). It\u2019s wonder that we love  celebrating and socializing. As a people Bhaktapurians are very relaxed, warm and friendly.\nBhaktapur, the fabled city of gods; a Newars town at the eastern rim of the Kathmandu valley is a wonderful amalgam of religious and cultural attracitions. The city chowks, and lanes bespeak a vibrancy and energy that are impossible for anybody to miss. The sheer number of festivities, dances, songs and traditions, indigineous and unique to bhaktapur give it a distinct identity, one that is in many ways less influenced by the urbanization and modernity that have taken over must of Kathmandu and Patan.\nGeographically, Bhaktapur is almost as diverseas its culture, 2 Municipalities and 16 VDC\u2019s, 13 km east from the Capital city Kathmandu. Situated at altitude of 1401meters above sea level, with the area of 138 sq km and founded by Kind Ananda Dev In 889 A.D. Bhaktapur is said to have been in the shape of Conch, the sacred emblem of Lord Bishnu, literally, Bhaktapur refers the \u201cthe city of Devotees\u201d.\nOne of Bhaktapur Key Attraction is its extreme contrasts which further add this theme of diversity: towering temples look down upon wooden houses built on stilts while tourist standards hotels sit just meters away from ancient reefs.\nRugged mountains reach dramatically for the sky while their rainforest \u2013clad slopes, sweep down to flood plain teeming with forest life. Cool highland hideaways roll dosn to warm and rich humid mangroves. \n\nFor the perfect holiday full of surprise, the time is now, the place is Bhaktapur.\nFurther information on Bhaktapur can also be obatained from www.igobhaktapur.com","category_list":[{"id":"124947834245370","name":"Tourist Information"},{"id":"180816211956170","name":"Cultural Gifts Store"}],"cover":{"cover_id":"805867829494688","source":"https:\/\/scontent.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-xfp1\/v\/t1.0-9\/10433094_805867829494688_2791527801915557300_n.jpg?oh=ffead8e4b2ed5d2afc8c8432b4693f0b&oe=55DEF659","offset_y":59,"offset_x":0}},{"category":"Church\/religious organization","id":"1481492695430485","name":"\u092c\u093e\u0932\u0915\u094b\u091f \u0927\u093f\u092e\u0947: \u0916\u0932:","likes":308,"talking_about_count":0,"were_here_count":3,"location":{"street":"Balkot-5, Bhaktapur","city":"Bhaktapur","country":"Nepal","zip":"","latitude":27.6667,"longitude":85.4167},"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/\u0025E0\u0025A4\u0025AC\u0025E0\u0025A4\u0025BE\u0025E0\u0025A4\u0025B2\u0025E0\u0025A4\u002595\u0025E0\u0025A5\u00258B\u0025E0\u0025A4\u00259F-\u0025E0\u0025A4\u0025A7\u0025E0\u0025A4\u0025BF\u0025E0\u0025A4\u0025AE\u0025E0\u0025A5\u002587-\u0025E0\u0025A4\u002596\u0025E0\u0025A4\u0025B2\/1481492695430485","phone":"9840099410","category_list":[{"id":"187714557925874","name":"Religious Organization"}],"cover":{"cover_id":"1617591991820554","source":"https:\/\/scontent.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-xpt1\/v\/t1.0-9\/p180x540\/11150274_1617591991820554_8575205449007289057_n.jpg?oh=456574b4bdd8dd75d2a370c0d384d35c&oe=55D3E7FF","offset_y":64,"offset_x":0}},{"category":"Education","id":"258886717492848","name":"VHS Bhaktapur","likes":2575,"talking_about_count":56,"were_here_count":0,"location":{"street":"Adharsha-7","city":"Bhaktapur","country":"Nepal","zip":"44800","latitude":27.667460168556,"longitude":85.437331551743},"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/VHSBhaktapur","phone":"+977 166  11 283","website":"http:\/\/www.vhsbhaktapur.org","description":"The VHS Bhaktapur is a community learning center in Bhaktapur.

Given such unequaled opulence in ancient art and culture, Bhaktapur is more like an open museum, and the ambiance here is such that it instantly transports visitors back by centuries the moment they step into its territory.\n\nBhaktapur has its gem in the Durbar Square\u2014a World Heritage site listed by the UNESCO. Strewn with unique palaces, temples and monasteries best admired for their exquisite artworks in wood, metal and stone, the palatial enclave has bewitched pilgrims and travelers for centuries. Yet, they are not all though. Adding to the mesmerizing environs is the holy Himalaya that makes the backdrop of the city. Stretching all along the township, the panoramic Himalaya levitates in the skyline as if to keep vigilance on the city\u2019s enviable beauty and splendor.\n\nBhaktapur, at 1,401 meters above sea level, spreads over an area of 6.88 square kilometers. It grows from a collection of villages strung along the old trade route between India and Tibet. The capital city of the Greater Malla Kingdom till the 15th century AD, Bhaktapur was founded in the 12th century by King Ananda Malla, but it was only in the early 18th century that this city took its present shape. It was at that time that many of Bhaktapur\u2019s greatest monuments were built by the then Malla rulers.\n\nMonuments\tCulture & Festivals\tHandicrafts\tPreservation Efforts\nDurbar Square\tTaumadhi Square\tDattatreya Square\tPrevious Menu\nMONUMENTS\n\nMonumental masterpieces in Bhaktapur are innumerable, and each is more attractive than the other. Mostly terra-cotta structures supported by carved wooden columns, elaborately carved struts, windows and doors, gilded roofs and pinnacles, open spacious courts all around and, above all, the fascinating divine images presiding over the monument\u2014many edifices have many things in common, yet their varied shape, size and designs make the one even more wondrous than the other. Furthermore, each of their components reflects the religious belief, social outlook and the economic status of the builders, and the monuments in all carry along a rich artistic tradition of the native Newars.\n\nIn Bhaktapur, visitors confront a smaller or larger monument almost at every ten or twenty steps. Perhaps stunned by the clusters of monuments, a visitor in the past had admired the Kathmandu Valley, saying that \"every other building (in the Valley) is a temple and every other day a festival\". The proportion, owing to continual external invasions and natural calamities, might have changed over centuries, yet the presence of variously shaped and sized monuments in Bhaktapur is still awe-inspiring. The world-famous Nyataponla Temple, Bhairavnath Temple, Taleju Temple, 55-Window Palace, Golden Gate, Golden Faucet, Big Bell, Yaksheswor Mahadev Temple, Dattatreya Temple, Peacock Window, Taja Math, Pujari Math, Wakupati Narayan Temple, Nava Durga Temple, Chandeswori Temple, Barahi Temple, Bharbacho Gate, Terra-cotta Windows and Nepal\u2019s largest Shiva Lingum at Hanumanghat, and such historic ponds as Ta-Pukhu, Na-Pukhu, Bhajya-Pukhu and Bahre-Pukhu (Kamal Pokhari) are simply a few among many that embellish the city\u2019s brick- and stone-paved squares, courtyards and open fields. Besides, the presence of a great many Buddhist monuments, many of them rubbing shoulders with Hindu shrines, simply reaffirms the age-old Nepalese tradition of social harmony and religious tolerance among its peace-loving populace. Because of this time-tested tradition, Bhaktapur\u2019s well known Lokeswor Mahavihar, Prasannasheel Mahavihar, Chatu Brahma Mahavihar, Jaya Kirti Mahavihar, Sukra-varna Mahavihar, Dipanker Mahavihar and many other Buddhist shrines have been the places of esteem and adoration for the Hindus alike.\n\nCULTURE & FESTIVALS\n\nThe cultural traditions of Bhaktapur are no less glorious than its artistic masterpieces. The ancient ritual dances and festivals here are observed with the same fervor and enthusiasm as they were centuries ago. Consequently, the city is still a venue for a great many festivals and cultural dances, many of them as unique as the city itself. While Bhaktapur\u2019s Gai-Jatra (July\/August) and the tantrically-inspired Nava Durga Dance (October-June), which is comprised of the city\u2019s protectress deities, are the \"only ones of their kinds\" in Nepal, the Biska Jatra (April), one of Nepal\u2019s greatest and most exciting festivals, is the only such event observed according to the official solar calendar.\n\nHANDICRAFTS\n\nBesides the physical monuments and cultural festivities, the Newars of Bhaktapur have also inherited a long history of craftsmanship. It is here where visitors can have rare close-up views of Nepal\u2019s master craftsmen giving continuity to their time-honored traditions of art. In its two famed Pottery Squares, they can see potters giving shape to lumps of clay on their traditional wooden wheels. Besides, they also encounter the city\u2019s well-acclaimed artisans who, with their wondrously skilled hands, produce a great variety of handicrafts. Bhaktapur\u2019s indigenous handicraft varieties include paubha scroll paintings, papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 masks, cotton cloth, woodcarvings, metalwork, jewelry and ceramic products. In addition, the home-spun haku-patasi (black sari), black cap and the delicious Juju-dhau, literally the \"King of all yogurt varieties\", have also made this city a favored spot for tourists and the Nepalese alike.\n\nPRESERVATION EFFORTS\n\nFor Bhaktapur and its tradition-loving locals, having monuments and culture alone is not all. For them, preservation of the mankind\u2019s shared glories is as much important as the creation of new ones. Keeping this in mind, Bhaktapur Municipality has launched an ambitious campaign for the purpose. In this course, the local body so far has carried out massive restoration of the Nyataponla and Bhairavnath temples, Ta-Pukhu (Siddha Pokhari), the Bhandarkhal Complex, and many other monuments of both religious and archeological importance. Now on the anvil of the municipality are the undertakings involving the rehabilitation of the Taleju Temple Complex, Chatu Brahma Mahavihar, Yaksheswor Mahadev Temple and the 55-Window Palace. In addition, the upkeep of the streets and squares will continue as it had in the past. The most notable part of all these conservation efforts is the active participation of the locals as well as the visiting tourists. While the locals on their part contribute with their labor and skills, tourists do the same through their moral and monetary support.\n\nBhaktapur Municipality\u2019s commitment to the preservation and promotion of the city and its glorious traditions of art and culture also has taken shape into the legendary Bhaktapur Festival 1997. Organized by the local body for five consecutive days, from October 22 to 26, 1997, the mega event\u2014the first and biggest of its kind ever held in Nepal\u2014had been instrumental in promoting not only Bhaktapur, but also the whole nation in the international arena.\n\nEffortful of realizing its noble objectives, Bhaktapur Municipality has also enforced a ban on vehicles in the Durbar Square. Effective since 1992, the law forbids heavy vehicles from getting into the city core and all kinds of automobiles into the palatial enclave. Because of the municipality\u2019s endeavors and cooperation from the local citizens, Bhaktapur today is Nepal\u2019s one of the least polluted urban areas, besides being the country\u2019s best preserved city.\n\nGiven the historic city\u2019s artistic and cultural riches combined with the unspoilt natural atmosphere all around it, a visit to Bhaktapur will sure to become an experience of a lifetime for many. A quiet stroll down the city\u2019s tranquil streets not only take them into a drastically different socio-cultural environment, but also help them explore a glorious dimension of human civilization that is Bhaktapur.\n\nDURBAR SQUARE\n\nBhaktapur\u2019s Durbar Square is the gem not only of Bhaktapur, but also of the entire nation. The most fascinating structure here is the world-renowned 55-Window Palace. The elaborately carved windows and doors are something that visitors simply cannot help admiring. The seat of royalty before 1769 AD, the building now houses the National Art Gallery\u2014the museum better known for its rich collection of paubha scroll paintings and breathtaking artworks in stone.\n\nThe world famous Golden Gate rubs shoulders with the 55-Window Palace. An unparalleled specimen of repousse art dating back to 1756 , it is the entrance to the marvelous Taleju Temple Complex. Getting into it leads to a number of artistica-lly designed chowks (courtyards) including the Royal Bath, which is adorned with the well-admired Golden Faucet among others.\n\nAnother artwork that unfailing-ly bewitches visitors in the Square is the Big Bell. Big enough to match its name, the bell was erected by Ranajit Malla (r. 1722-1769), Bhaktapur\u2019s last Malla king. It was used in those days for paying homage to Goddess Taleju, the lineage deity of Malla rulers, as well as to call assemblies of the citizens to discuss on given subjects concerning the state. Today, it is rung twice a day as a mark of tribute to the goddess. Right next to it is a smaller Barking Bell. To one\u2019s surprise, all dogs around it start whining the moment it is rung by its caretaker.\n\nThe Yaksheswor Mahadev Temple equally adds to the Square\u2019s unparallaled beauty. Named after its builder king, Yaksha Malla (r. 1428-82), the two-storied pagoda was constructed after Kathmandu\u2019s world famous Pashupatinath temple. It is noted for its wooden struts full of erotic carvings.\n\nOther notable monuments in and around the historic Durbar Square are: the octagonal Chyasin Mandap, Siddhi Laxmi Temple, Shiva Temple (Fasi-dega), Vatsala Temple, Bhandarkhal Complex, Chatu Brahma Mahavihar, Indrayani Temple, Balakhu Ganesh Temple, Tripura-sundari Temple and the Char Dham symbolizing the four greatest Hindu pilgrimage sites.\n\nTAUMADHI SQUARE\n\nThe Nyataponla Temple presides over the Taumadhi Square. Dating back to 1702 AD, the colossal five-storied edifice is the country\u2019s tallest pagoda temple. The struts, doors, windows and tympanums\u2014each embellished with attractively carved divine figures\u2014perfectly portray the creative tradition of Newar craftsmen. The temple is dedicated to Goddess Siddhi Laxmi, the manifestation of female force and creativity. The latest major renovation of this monument was carried out in 1997 AD by Bhaktapur Municipality using the revenue it collected from tourists.\n\nNext to the Nyataponla Temple is the rectangular shaped Bhairavnath Temple. It houses a gilded bust of Bhairav, the ferocious manifestation of Lord Shiva. The three-storied pagoda was razed to the grounds by the 1934-earthquake, and its latest renovation was undertaken by Bhaktapur Municipality in 1995 AD.\n\nThe enclosed complex facing the Nyataponla Temple is dedicated to Tilmadhav Narayan, a manifestation of Lord Vishnu, who is one of the Supreme Triumvirate of Hindu pantheon. A few steps ahead it, to the southwest, lies the famous Pottery Square, where visitors can see the city\u2019s well-known potters making variously shaped and sized earthenware. The major monumental highlight of this square is a temple of Jeth Ganesh, which dates back to the 14th century.\n\nDATTATREYA SQUARE\n\nThe Dattatreya Square is Bhaktapur\u2019s third dazzling gem. The seat of royalty till the 15th century, the area still houses a great number of historic monuments including many wondrous Maths (residential mansions) and temples.\n\nThe Dattatreya Temple is the main attraction of the Square. Constructed by King Yaksha Malla, the giant three-storied temple is believed to have been built with the stem of a single tree. Having defied series of calamities, it still bears testimony to the incredible achievement made in those regal days of the Nepalese history.\n\nThe Wane Layaku complex, which lies to the south-western corner of the Dattatreya temple, is noted for Bhaktapur\u2019s second Taleju shrine. Enclosed with old houses, the courtyard sees throngs of people, especially during the Mohani (Dashain) festival, when a rare Ghau-batacha (Water Clock) is put on public display. During the Malla Era, the water-clock was used by the then rulers and astrologers for fixing \"propitious moments\" for commencing and concluding various state and social ceremonies.\n\nThe Peacock Window, which is also called the \"Mona Lisa of Nepal\", is a rare masterpiece in wood. Dating back to the early 15th century, the unique latticed window has an intricately carved peacock in its center. The window adorns the Pujari Math which, with rows of exquisitely carved windows and doors, is equally appealing. The building presently houses the Woodcarving Museum. The museum has a rich collection of unique pieces in wood.\n\nThe Brass & Bronze Museum, housed in the historic Chikanpha Math, is the next highlight of the Square. It has a wide collection of bronze and brasswares including the ritual jars, utensils, water vessels, pots, spittoons and similar other household items.\n\nNear the Dattatreya Square is the Wakupati Narayan Temple. Dedicated to Lord Vishnu, the two-storied structure is a unique specimen of pagoda architecture. Next to it is Bhaktapur\u2019s second Pottery Square.\n\nBesides Bhaktapur\u2019s three well-acclaimed Squares, there are many other spots within the expanse where visitors can experience a lot more. The recently-restored Ta-Pukhu (Siddha Pokhari), Ancha-Pukhu, Khancha-Pukhu, Barahi Temple, Lokeswor Mahavihar, Nava Durga Temple, the Terra-cotta Windows at Tuchhimala and Nepal\u2019s largest Shiva Lingum at Hanumanghat are some of Bhaktapur\u2019s monumental glories which tourists visiting this ancient city simply do not like to miss","hours":{"mon_1_open":"10:00","mon_1_close":"19:00","tue_1_open":"10:00","tue_1_close":"19:00","wed_1_open":"10:00","wed_1_close":"19:00","thu_1_open":"10:00","thu_1_close":"19:00","fri_1_open":"10:00","fri_1_close":"19:00","sat_1_open":"10:00","sat_1_close":"19:00","sun_1_open":"10:00","sun_1_close":"19:00"},"category_list":[{"id":"2200","name":"Company"}],"cover":{"cover_id":"1046480398712698","source":"https:\/\/scontent.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-xtp1\/t31.0-8\/s720x720\/10861090_1046480398712698_1088996292154512883_o.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}},{"category":"Non-governmental organization (ngo)","id":"228044317209863","name":"Bhaktapur Animal Welfare Society","likes":2759,"talking_about_count":18,"were_here_count":23,"location":{"street":"","city":"Bhaktapur","country":"Nepal","zip":"00977","latitude":27.6664076886,"longitude":85.4184629827},"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/BhaktapurAnimalWelfareSociety","phone":"xxxxxxx","website":"http:\/\/www.baws.org.np","description":"Bhaktapur Animal Welfare Society (BAWS) is a professional non-profitable, non-government organization involved in welfare, saftey and protection of animals and birds that are the crutial part of our society.

However, at present it is running as an independent organization.\nThe methodology will be based on similar systems as that exists in German speaking countries, whereas the content will be filled with data directly from Nepal. Therefore, the list of professions available in Nepal, list of educational paths as well as cultural specific aspects (i.e. societal boundaries) will be considered.\nScientific test will be provided online as well as in offline version, which shall guide students to choose a right education and future profession. \nThe second and free product of Career Disha  Nepal will provide a comprehensive online database, which will give detailed information on the jobs and professions. It can be accessed via a link from the analysis as well as independently through a search result. In general the aim of this part is to make career planning related information more transparent and accessible. All possible professions will be listed and closely described, including the demand in the labour market, what kind of organization employs somebody from this field as well as the possible educational paths and institutes. \nA third product is planned already but is not  a part of the initial project. An Ability Based Test will be built in the second phase upon the first test and will create a rough ability profile (assessment through quizzes and self assessment). With this the student is able to identify the jobs where s\/he brings the right skills (technical understanding, capability of conflict management, rhetoric skills \u2026).\nBeside these main technical products, we will develop supportive services over time like guidelines on how to use the tests for counselling sessions; seminars for counsellors or other career counselling related material that provide a holistic service in this area.\n\nCareer Disha will run as a Social Business, with the aim to be self sustaining on the long run. As we expect high initial costs the strategy would be to use grants and subsidies for the initial costs additional to the investment of the local partners. \n","mission":"VISION AND IMPACT:\n\nThe problem we want to solve:\nUnemployment and youth unemployment is a big issue in Nepal. On the one hand organizations are always in search for persons with the right qualification and keeping them on the long run, many organizations face a high fluctuation. Young employees only realize during their first work experiences (normally after their Bachelor or Master) if they really fit into their profession. \nOn the other hand there are many young people struggling through the various kinds of education (+2 in management, Bachelor in IT, Master in English) and end up not fitting into the available jobs in the market. \nMany young people lack awareness about the variety of possible professions and choose thereby rather an educational path to a profession with higher prestige than one fitting to their competencies. \n\nOur Vision\nCreating understanding to parents, teachers and students in Nepal about career counselling and have understanding on student\u2019s personality, ability and interest which plays a crucial role in finding a suitable job and a pathway regarding Education in future. \n\nPositive Social Impact:\nChoosing an educational path based on career counselling should create a higher degree of harmonization between job-seeking youth and the need for qualified staff in the private as well as in the third sector. \nAs this impact is only to be measured on a long run and may also depend upon several other factors (development of the specific field of education, development of the labour market, societal boundaries for certain groups on specific jobs \u2026.), we would also define the social impact on a smaller scale in reducing the lack of orientation of the individual student with regard to the best choice of education. \nAlso economical benefit will occur in two different ways. Firstly, families will be shown alternative professions for their children. In many cases this alternative options might be cheaper as there is not such a high demand for the not so popular educations and therefore it is to assume that the fees would be less. \nAnother benefit will be an indirect one, also hard to measure. By choosing the career path, youth and later young adults will have higher possibilities in the job market. When they after their education join the labour market in a field where there is a high demand for skilled persons rather than over saturated fields like Management their placement ability and thereby the time of unemployment or underemployment falls. \n","hours":{"mon_1_open":"07:00","mon_1_close":"17:00","tue_1_open":"07:00","tue_1_close":"17:00","wed_1_open":"07:00","wed_1_close":"17:00","thu_1_open":"07:00","thu_1_close":"17:00","fri_1_open":"07:00","fri_1_close":"17:00"},"category_list":[{"id":"187751327923426","name":"Educational Organization"}],"cover":{"cover_id":"1504086386497248","source":"https:\/\/scontent.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-xaf1\/t31.0-8\/s720x720\/10582889_1504086386497248_1363385074794013615_o.jpg","offset_y":41,"offset_x":0},"founded":"2014 April"},{"category":"Local business","id":"300082053471008","name":"Kathmandu Fun Park..sanga","likes":171,"talking_about_count":0,"were_here_count":1619,"location":{"street":"","city":"Kathmandu","country":"Nepal","zip":"","latitude":27.647058662386,"longitude":85.466858463467},"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Kathmandu-Fun-Parksanga\/300082053471008","category_list":[{"id":"133436743388217","name":"Arts &amp;

I believe that God put us in this jolly world to be happy and enjoy life. Happiness does not come from being rich, nor merely being successful in your career, nor by self-indulgence. One step towards happiness is to make yourself healthy and strong while you are a boy, so that you can be useful and so you can enjoy life when you are a man. Nature study will show you how full of beautiful and wonderful things God has made the world for you to enjoy. Be contented with what you have got and make the best of it. Look on the bright side of things instead of the gloomy one. But the real way to get happiness is by giving out happiness to other people. Try and leave this world a little better than you found it and when your turn comes to die, you can die happy in feeling that at any rate you have not wasted your time but have done your best. 'Be Prepared' in this way, to live happy and to die happy \u2014 stick to your Scout Promise always \u2014 even after you have ceased to be a boy \u2014 and God help you to do it.\nRobert Stephenson Smyth Baden-Powell","mission":"Creating Better World ","category_list":[{"id":"2603","name":"Non-Profit Organization"}],"cover":{"cover_id":"926314704051576","source":"https:\/\/scontent.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-xpf1\/v\/t1.0-9\/s720x720\/10613160_926314704051576_1020036988517565690_n.jpg?oh=345eddaeaa3c1a81f7135e9c939a1233&oe=55CFAF60","offset_y":56,"offset_x":0}},{"category":"Community organization","id":"377769235731111","name":"Rotaract Club of Bhaktapur","likes":593,"talking_about_count":23,"were_here_count":0,"location":{"street":"Bhaktapur Durbar Square","city":"Bhaktapur","country":"Nepal","zip":"","latitude":27.66711809336,"longitude":85.416485423279},"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/racbhaktapur","website":"http:\/\/rotaractnepal.org\/?page=club_details&club_id=17","description":"Chartered in June 2006 in the beautiful ancient city Bhaktapur known as 'The Tantric City'.\nRotaract Club Of Bhaktapur is a community based Rotaract Club sponsored by Rotary Club of Bhaktapur.At present we have 20 active members.\nWe meet twice in a month,on the 1st and 3rd Saturday of English month.\nMost of the members are students and willing to do something for the social change.\n","category_list":[{"id":"2260","name":"Community Organization"}],"cover":{"cover_id":"408605105980857","source":"https:\/\/scontent.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-xaf1\/v\/t1.0-9\/16100_408605105980857_2236565152982301598_n.jpg?oh=0fda87e8254158ab5a5ebc99cf7e6892&oe=55D00E17","offset_y":48,"offset_x":0}},{"category":"Non-profit organization","id":"1625818967643482","name":"Visionary Youth Initiative Foundation Nepal -VYIFN","likes":1341,"talking_about_count":26,"were_here_count":2,"location":{"street":"","city":"Bhaktapur","country":"Nepal","zip":"","latitude":27.6667,"longitude":85.4167},"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/vyifn","phone":" 977 9841719804   (President: Mr. Aakash Jung karki),  9808606185     (Secretary: Mrs. Shusma Panta),  9843933054    (Vice-Secretary:Mr.Roshan Pyatha)","website":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/vyifn","description":"VYIFN is a non-government, non-profit making organisation registered under the Nepal organization act 2034 B.S.

We insist you visit Nepal to see the astounding beauty that nature itself has given to the country, simultaneously accompanied by its very unique and aspiring diverse cultures and the warm hospitality of the locals that will make your tour to Nepal an unforgettable experience.\n\nBrowse in any contents in the website to see what Nepal and Alpine Travel Service offers you.","category_list":[{"id":"189811544396762","name":"Tour Company"},{"id":"162914327091136","name":"Travel Agency"}],"cover":{"cover_id":"888192471227357","source":"https:\/\/scontent.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-xta1\/v\/t1.0-9\/s720x720\/10290652_888192471227357_5454321465460632960_n.jpg?oh=eac9f02a3eb8b0cce642ec9bd84b7796&oe=55D255C1","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}},{"category":"Spas\/beauty\/personal care","id":"290539951077996","name":"Fingure Tip Beauty Parlor & Cosmetics","likes":469,"talking_about_count":6,"were_here_count":0,"location":{"street":"New Baneshwor, Panchkumari Marg, Kathmandu","city":"Kathmandu","country":"Nepal","zip":"9779851177566","latitude":27.6739829,"longitude":85.4310186},"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/FingureTipBeautyParlorCosmetics1","description":"WELCOME TO .....\n\nFINGURE TIP BEAUTY PARLOR & COSMETICS\n\"Luxury Parlor Where You Will Feel Unique & Special\" \n\nRemember Us For:-\n# All Kinds Of Parlor Services (we provide FEMINA services) In Reasonable Price\n# Premium Range Branded Cosmetic Products Are Available Here\n\nREVLON\n LAKME\n OLAY\n LOTUS\n VLCC\n GARNIER\nNEW LOOK\nGODREJ\nHIMALAYA\nSTREETWEAR\n\nCONTACT DETAILS :\nFINGURE TIP BEAUTY PARLOR & COSMETICS\nPanchkumari Marg, New Baneshwor\nContact N : 9803284057 \n\nHURRY UP, WE ARE PROVIDING SPECIAL DISCOUNT OFFERS & GIFT HAMPERS FOR FIRST 50 VISITORS...\n","hours":{"mon_1_open":"09:00","mon_1_close":"18:00","tue_1_open":"09:00","tue_1_close":"18:00","wed_1_open":"09:00","wed_1_close":"18:00","thu_1_open":"09:00","thu_1_close":"18:00","fri_1_open":"09:00","fri_1_close":"18:00","sat_1_open":"09:00","sat_1_close":"18:00","sun_1_open":"09:00","sun_1_close":"18:00"},"category_list":[{"id":"199236533423806","name":"Beauty Salon"},{"id":"146059155460366","name":"Makeup Artist"},{"id":"138322342904312","name":"Skin Care"}],"cover":{"cover_id":"290554711076520","source":"https:\/\/scontent.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn2\/t31.0-8\/s720x720\/892776_290554711076520_475412155_o.jpg","offset_y":53,"offset_x":0}},{"category":"Spas\/beauty\/personal care","id":"758397514249665","name":"Subhan beautyparlour and training center","likes":120,"talking_about_count":1,"were_here_count":0,"location":{"street":"Araniko highway,Surya binayak bus stop ","city":"Bhaktapur","country":"Nepal","zip":"0977","latitude":27.6667,"longitude":85.4167},"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Subhan-beautyparlour-and-training-center\/758397514249665","phone":"9849174626","category_list":[{"id":"200814353265561","name":"Spa"},{"id":"174177802634376","name":"Hair Salon"},{"id":"144873802247220","name":"Cosmetics &amp; Beauty Supply"}],"cover":{"cover_id":"789418294480920","source":"https:\/\/scontent.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-xfa1\/t31.0-8\/p180x540\/1559333_789418294480920_978269923505520295_o.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}},{"category":"Business services","id":"361061117375151","name":"Uj'bee'zz collection","likes":237,"talking_about_count":5,"were_here_count":1,"location":{"street":"bkt 17","city":"Bhaktapur","country":"Nepal","zip":"977","latitude":27.6667,"longitude":85.4167},"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Ujbeezz-collection\/361061117375151","phone":"9841369008.9813002461","category_list":[{"id":"128753240528981","name":"Women&#039;s Clothing Store"}],"cover":{"cover_id":"366460460168550","source":"https:\/\/scontent.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-xfp1\/v\/t1.0-9\/s720x720\/10670114_366460460168550_6175245346782959729_n.jpg?oh=9aaf293965b65b24c0ac9ca3f1f07c24&oe=55D25B81","offset_y":18,"offset_x":0}}],"paging":{"next":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/v2.0\/search?fields=category,id,name,likes,talking_about_count,were_here_count,location,link,phone,website,description,members,mission,general_info,products,hours,category_list,cover,emails,founded&limit=50000&type=place&q=\u00252A&center=27.672222,85.427778&distance=50000&access_token=114463268581528|6619aa9c8ea70e1228c17c69ab1882be&offset=50000&__after_id=enc_AdBI9hpLTjmlSlGO0nmoRRsVvShXtSZCrQLIjkBePoz5G2KzP6IUgzH6KMFJcDTsKj4gHg5L7eadCvAJBhc7xIvDr"}}
