I am sure post office is relevant for many in the village who are not using banks. With more and more using banks in the villages, I wonder whether post office would have relevance for money orders sending and receiving. I have the privilege of having the service from this post office when I was studying at Science college , Patna , Patna College ,Patna and University of Delhi between 1984-1994. My father Haji Abdur Rahman , a retired Principal In Charge of High School Mathurapur was sending me money from this post office regularly.",
