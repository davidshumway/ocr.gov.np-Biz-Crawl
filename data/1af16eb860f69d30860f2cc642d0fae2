The receptionist told me to keep trying to connect before admitting there was a problem with the main connection. I was sick and asked for bottled water, it never arrived. I asked again the next day, stating that I hadn't received any water the previous day. The receptionist looked bored and the water took an hour to arrive. This hotel is right next to a construction site, and the views are ugly. The worst part was the rude, unhelpful staff who seemed to think I was doing them a favour by staying there. Please don't stay at this hotel. ",
