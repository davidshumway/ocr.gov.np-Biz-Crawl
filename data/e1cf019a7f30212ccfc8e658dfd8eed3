            "text" : "Rajdevi Temple, one of the\nfamous temples in Eastern region,\nis situated at Rajbiraj – 9, Saptari.\nThe temple holds high religious\nsignificance in the life of the\npeople of Rajbiraj and also the\ntown itself is named after it (‘Raj’\nfrom the name of the temple and\n‘biraj’ meaning residing). It is\nbelieved that the stone carved\nstatues of Gods and Goddess\ninside the temple are more than\n1000 years old and they are also\nsaid to have been kept in the\nsame position they were found in.\nThis is also one of the reasons\nwhy the statues are underground.\nGoddess Rajdevi is one of the\nmany forms of Goddess Durga ,\nthe goddess of strength and\npower.\nDuring the festival of Dashain,\nRajdevi Temple welcomes\nthousands of devotees coming to\npay their homage to the Goddess.\nMany people make the offering of\nanimal sacrifices to please the\ngoddess on the last three days of\nNavaratri . One of largest temples\nof Rajbiraj, it is also accompanied\nby another temple beside it. The\nChitragupta temple that lay on\nthe right side of the temple itself\nis unique as the temple of\nChitragupta is quite rare to find.\nIt is said that while digging the\nplace where the temple stands\ntoday, people found one pen\nalong with Chitragupta. The pen is\nbelieved to belong to Chitragupta\nwho is responsible for keeping\nthe records of the people and\ntheir deeds while they lived on\nthe earth. The pen is kept on\nauction every year and the\nhighest bidder gets to keep the\npen for a year.\nBesides the goddess, the statues\nof other gods like Lord Shiva,\nGanesh, Vishnu were also found\nwhile digging and are enshrined in\nthe temple. Devotees, not only\nfrom Rajbiraj but also from\nsurrounding areas and most of\nthe places of Nepal come to the\ntemple to worship the goddess.\nThere is also a podium for\nmarriage (Vivaha MandapI) in the\ntemple premises where the\nmarriage ceremony is conducted.\nRajdevi temple holds great\nhistorical, religious and cultural\nsignificance, not only in the life\nof people living in Rajbiraj but in\nlife of those living in other areas\nas well. However, the place and\nthe temple is not so popular like\nother temples because of\ninefficiency of the government in\nits promotion. Nevertheless, the\ntemple holds high religious,\ncultural and historical\nsignificance in Rajbiraj and the\npeople living there.",
