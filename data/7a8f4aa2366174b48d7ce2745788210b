With an area of and a population of approximately 27 million, Nepal is the world's 93rd largest country by land mass and the 41st most populous country. It is located in the Himalayas and bordered to the north by the People's Republic of China, and to the south, east, and west by the Republic of India. Nepal is separated from Bangladesh by the narrow Indian Siliguri Corridor and from Bhutan by the Indian state of Sikkim. Kathmandu is the nation's capital and largest metropolis.The mountainous north of Nepal has eight of the world's ten tallest mountains, including the highest point on Earth, Mount Everest, called Sagarm\u0101th\u0101 (\u0938\u0917\u0930\u092e\u093e\u0925\u093e) in the Nepali language. More than 240 peaks over above sea level are located in Nepal. The southern Terai region is fertile and humid.Hinduism is practiced by about 81.3\u0025 of Nepalis, the highest percentage of any country. Buddhism is linked historically with Nepal and is practiced by 9\u0025 of its people, followed by Islam at 4.4\u0025, Kiratism 3.1\u0025, Christianity 1.4\u0025, and animism 0.4\u0025. A large portion of the population, especially in the hill region, may identify themselves as both Hindu and Buddhist, which can be attributed to the syncretic nature of both faiths in Nepal.","category_list":[{"id":"2400","name":"Country"}]}],"paging":{"next":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/v2.0\/search?fields=category,id,name,likes,talking_about_count,were_here_count,location,link,phone,website,description,members,mission,general_info,products,hours,category_list,cover,emails,founded&limit=50000&type=place&q=\u00252A&center=26.6172621,86.7013894&distance=50000&access_token=114463268581528|6619aa9c8ea70e1228c17c69ab1882be&offset=50000&__after_id=enc_AdC7Ul52jul1zTcuYPKMAIxWK4BmZCkpfZAmwo7qvWd9tJnp7c5cPdEZCDARpM5GZANW79pJt6Ixk1AdPYdyQeZBZCy4wK"}}
