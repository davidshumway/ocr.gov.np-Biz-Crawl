Established in 1972, IOE is Nepal's oldest and the widest engineering education consortium. IOE provides Diploma, Bachelors, Masters and Ph.D. degrees in engineering and architecture education through its constituent campuses and several private colleges affiliated to it.\n\nHistory of engineering education in Nepal can be traced since 1930, when Technical Training School was established. Engineering section of the school offered only trades and civil sub-overseers programs. In 1959, Nepal Engineering Institute, with the assistance of the government of India, started offering civil overseer courses leading to Diploma in Civil Engineering. The Technical Training Institute established in 1965, with the assistance from the Government of Federal Republic of Germany, offered technician courses in General courses in General Mechanics, Auto Mechanics, Electrical Engineering and Mechanical Drafting.\nIn 1972, the Nepal Engineering Institute at Pulchowk and the Technical Training Institute at Thapathali were brought together under the umbrella of the Tribhuvan University to constitute the Institute of Engineering and the Nepal Engineering Institute and the Technical Training Institute were renamed as Pulchowk campus and Thapathali Campus respectively.\nSince then, the Institute of Engineering has expanded considerably. The technician programs in Electrical, Electronics, Refrigeration\/Air-conditioning Engineering were started in the Pulchowk campus, with the assistance from UNDP\/ILO. The Architecture Technician program was started by the IOE in its own effort. With the assistance of the World Bank and UK, later, the existing technician level courses were strengthened and Bachelor's Degree level course in Civil Engineering was started.Similarly, with the assistance of the World Bank, the Swiss Government, and the Canadian Government, Bachelor Degree level courses in the Electronics, Electrical, Mechanical engineering and Architecture were started in the Pulchowk campus. From academic year 1998\/99 IOE has started Bachelor's Degree program in Computer Engineering. In 1996, Pulchowk campus, with support from the Norwegian Government, has started M.Sc. Courses in Urban Planning, Structural Engineering, Environmental Engineering and Water Resources Engineering Pulchowk Campus has also started M.Sc. courses in Renewable energy and Geothermal Engineering, Information and communication and Power systems Engineering effective from December, 2001. The diploma level programs at the Pulchowk Campus have been transferred to other three IOE campuses.\nThe Thapathali Campus is presently offering three-year Diploma level courses in Mechanical, Automobile, Electronics, Civil Engineering and Architecture.\nThe Eastern Region Campus in Dharan, which began operating from 1984, was built with the financial assistance from Asian Development Bank and the technical assistance from the UK. This campus initially offered courses at the trade and technician levels. Now, it is offering Diploma level courses in the Civil, Electrical, Mechanical and Refrigeration\/Air-conditioning Engineering. From academic year 2000\/2001 Bachelor's Degree program in Agricultural Engineering has been started.\nThe Western Region Campus in Pokhara of IOE became operational from 1987, with the assistance from the World Bank and UNDP\/ILO. Initially various trades and technician courses were offered at this campus. At present, it is offering Diploma level courses in the Civil, Electrical, Electronics, Automobile and Mechanical Engineering. From academic year 1999\/2000 Bachelor's Degree program in Civil Engineering has been started.\n\n(Source: http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Institute_of_Engineering)","mission":"Objectives of IOE\n\nThe First institutional objective of the IOE is to produce different levels of engineering manpower needed for meeting the national aspirations and goals. At present it is producing engineers and overseers as well as offering Master and Ph. D. study in various disciplines.\n\nThe second objective of the IOE is to perform various research and development works so as to strengthen the national engineering capabilities and solve engineering problems.\n\nThe Third IOE objective is to offer various types of trainings, sponsored courses, conducting problem oriented research and providing engineering consultancy services. This objective caters towards greater mobilation of the IOE human and physical resources for the technical advancement of the nation. In Addition to this, these activities help to bridge the increasing gap between the IOE\u2019s financial needs and resources, similarly, this objective can contribute to broaden the professional experience of the IOE staff, as well as, to supplement the staff earning so as to retain the staff within IOE by offering them additional financial incentives.","hours":{"mon_1_open":"10:00","mon_1_close":"17:00","tue_1_open":"10:00","tue_1_close":"17:00","wed_1_open":"10:00","wed_1_close":"17:00","thu_1_open":"10:00","thu_1_close":"17:00","fri_1_open":"10:00","fri_1_close":"17:00","sun_1_open":"10:00","sun_1_close":"17:00"},"category_list":[{"id":"108051929285833","name":"College &amp; University"}],"cover":{"cover_id":"417085404984620","source":"https:\/\/scontent.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-xaf1\/v\/t1.0-9\/s720x720\/318265_417085404984620_2101438295_n.jpg?oh=f308d2a53fadc2883e5ba2973ad6e519&oe=55CE863F","offset_y":10,"offset_x":0},"founded":"1972"},{"category":"Local business","id":"190922697630129","name":"Cell phone","likes":65344,"talking_about_count":10,"were_here_count":287,"location":{"street":"","city":"Karachi","state":"","country":"Pakistan","zip":"","latitude":27.6719492243,"longitude":85.332264341},"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Cell-phone\/190922697630129","category_list":[{"id":"2500","name":"Local Business"}],"cover":{"cover_id":"908498775872514","source":"https:\/\/scontent.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-xap1\/v\/t1.0-9\/s720x720\/10433211_908498775872514_6591789860402421052_n.jpg?oh=288a8f61ba64ac340a022d714f01f34b&oe=55E13532","offset_y":101,"offset_x":0}},{"category":"Local business","id":"586480114725731","name":"Mah Own World","likes":12,"talking_about_count":7,"were_here_count":516,"location":{"street":"","city":"Kathmandu","country":"Nepal","zip":"","latitude":27.66472683,"longitude":85.31893505},"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Mah-Own-World\/586480114725731","category_list":[{"id":"176831012360626","name":"Professional Services"}]},{"category":"Local business","id":"123062524471284","name":"Patan Museum","likes":149,"talking_about_count":11,"were_here_count":2467,"location":{"street":"Patan Dudar square","city":"Lalitpur","country":"Nepal","zip":"","latitude":27.673345796934,"longitude":85.325405341271},"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Patan-Museum\/123062524471284","website":"http:\/\/www.patanmuseum.gov.np\/","category_list":[{"id":"244600818962350","name":"History Museum"}]},{"category":"Local business","id":"276229765812136","name":"A.V.M Higher Secondary","likes":56,"talking_about_count":3,"were_here_count":650,"location":{"street":"","city":"Kathmandu","country":"Nepal","zip":"","latitude":27.670945235,"longitude":85.3143166983},"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/AVM-Higher-Secondary\/276229765812136","category_list":[{"id":"110152272401235","name":"High School"}]},{"category":"Local business","id":"468380923175137","name":"Aafnai Duniyama Kasai Ko Baal 6ena","likes":162,"talking_about_count":35,"were_here_count":2721,"location":{"street":"","city":"Kathmandu","country":"Nepal","zip":"","latitude":27.679345,"longitude":85.3078893},"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Aafnai-Duniyama-Kasai-Ko-Baal-6ena\/468380923175137","category_list":[{"id":"2500","name":"Local Business"}]},{"category":"Shopping\/retail","id":"559419827522093","name":"Lalitpur Central","likes":3070,"talking_about_count":7,"were_here_count":153,"location":{"street":"Lagankhel, Lalitpur","city":"Kathmandu","country":"Nepal","zip":"44700","latitude":27.667792816163,"longitude":85.321777230072},"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/lalitpurcentral","phone":"5004162, 5004163","website":"http:\/\/www.lalitpurcentral.com","category_list":[{"id":"109527622457518","name":"Shopping Mall"}],"cover":{"cover_id":"615333778597364","source":"https:\/\/scontent.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-xtf1\/v\/t1.0-9\/s720x720\/11138575_615333778597364_8466146943876447235_n.jpg?oh=6e4bedd5e2b2e0d5e6276965a34dcfc4&oe=55DB0F3E","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}},{"category":"Local business","id":"339875049555809","name":"Silauti Resort","likes":23,"talking_about_count":0,"were_here_count":91,"location":{"street":"Nakkhipot, Nakkhudole","city":"Jawalakhel","country":"Nepal","zip":"","latitude":27.6487983,"longitude":85.3115927},"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Silauti-Resort\/339875049555809","category_list":[{"id":"273819889375819","name":"Restaurant"}]},{"category":"Hotel","id":"130539440380003","name":"Hotel Goodwill Pvt.

When you move towards the core of this city, it would seem like a living museum because of its exquisite art and culture, its ancient monuments, shrines and temples, and because of the people who create them. This home of craftsmen is situated nearly 5 kilometers south of Kathmandu. A large part of Nepalese handicrafts is exported and about 90\u0025 of these handicrafts are manufactured in Patan. If you are an importer of handicrafts from Nepal or a souvenir buyer, you must at least visit Patan once while in Nepal. The most popular place in Patan for artists is Kanibahal, where Hotel Goodwill is located. When you step out of the hotel, you could observe the skillful artists working to produce different handicraft goods. Patan holds many cultural festivities in every average 15 days. One of them, which can be viewed from the hotel premises at the end of July is Mataya, a popular which is celebrated with long processions of devotees worshipping holy Buddhist stupas inside courtyards in Patan carrying lighted tapers. To celebrate all these, the hotel itself is decorated with lots of huge traditional style handmade statues, stone stupa, stone water taps, wood carvings, red brick (Dachi Appa) antique pillars etc. Every corner of the hotel has some type of Nepali art on the display. The hotel rooms are also named after the names of gods and goddesses. \n\nThus, Hotel Goodwill offers hospitality as well as a glimpse into the fertile land of Nepali art and culture.

It was established as Resources Nepal, a self-governing private organization in 1986. It became an independent, not-for-profit research foundation managed by a Governing Board and administered by its executive office since 2004. Dr Yonzon raised funds to transform Resources Himalaya, a 18 year old private institution into a non-government, not for profit, regional research foundation through Nepal Government approval in 2004. He donated his personal assets and cash worth US$ 108,571 (audited by Associates of Pricewater Cooperhouse in 2005) to the Foundation. He also provided the leadership that enabled the Foundation for nomination of the Global 2007 McArthur Award for Creative andEffective Institutions with a prize money of US $ 350,000.\nRHF has completed its 25 years of innovative research and capacity building on aspects of wildlife, biodiversity, and environment in Nepal, Bhutan and Sikkim. It has garnered regional experience through nearly 200 research projects. The milestones include Count Rhino '94 \u2010 the first comprehensive rhino survey in Nepal, GIS of high\u2010altitude forests and biodiversity, Status of the red panda in the Himalayas, Hornbill ecology, GIS database of protected areas of Nepal,Annapurna Conservation Area Management Plan, Elephant Conservation Action Plan, Snow Leopard Conservation Action Plan, Nepal Biodiversity Action Plan Draft, and 10 volumes of Conservation Plan of the Western Terai - Churiya Region as the primer for Terai Arc Landscape (TAL).

Also, Resources Himalaya assisted in developing \u201cRapid Biodiversity Survey Framework\u201d for all nine protected areas of Bhutan including Phobjikha Conservation Landscape Area Plan. RHF\u2019s competitive edge over others is its ability to deal with contemporary knowledge and issues connected with nature conservation.","category_list":[{"id":"2235","name":"Non-Governmental Organization (NGO)"}],"cover":{"cover_id":"512863322118132","source":"https:\/\/scontent.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn2\/t31.0-8\/s720x720\/1082597_512863322118132_214679916_o.jpg","offset_y":50,"offset_x":0},"founded":"1986"},{"category":"Local business","id":"109283069165093","name":"Staff College,Jawalakhel,Lalitpur","likes":58,"talking_about_count":6,"were_here_count":1092,"location":{"street":"","city":"Kathmandu","country":"Nepal","zip":"","latitude":27.671582703872,"longitude":85.314476677028},"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Staff-CollegeJawalakhelLalitpur\/109283069165093","website":"\u003C\u003Cnot-applicable>>","category_list":[{"id":"198890520141354","name":"Technical Institute"}]},{"category":"Media\/news\/publishing","id":"457161001021145","name":"Setopati","likes":242189,"talking_about_count":707449,"were_here_count":183,"location":{"street":"","city":"Lalitpur","country":"Nepal","zip":"","latitude":27.67850899808,"longitude":85.310367785463},"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/setopati","phone":"+977-1-5529319","website":"http:\/\/www.setopati.com","description":"Online destination for Nepal news, views, reviews, features, blogs and audio video content covering Nepali politics, society, market, arts, entertainment and sports.","mission":"www.setopati.com, are all about.

We are on the ground in 166 countries, working with them on their own solutions to global and national development challenges. As they develop local capacity, they draw on the people of UNDP and our wide range of partners.\n\nUNDP has been supporting the Nepalese people in their struggle against poverty since it opened an in-country office in 1963. Much of this support has gone to building up the capacity of government agencies, civil society and community groups to fight poverty, and to bringing these groups and Nepal's donors together to design and implement successful poverty alleviation projects.\n\nUNDP in Nepal concentrates its efforts for greater impact in the most remote, poor, and\/or conflict-affected areas of the mid- and far-western development regions and the Terai, where its rights-based interventions are targeted towards the disadvantaged and vulnerable groups. The UNDP programmes seek opportunities for joint programming with other United Nations organizations and engage in joint planning and monitoring of development activities in selected districts.\n\nCurrently the overarching priority of our work in Nepal is to help the Government and its people build a lasting peace and achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by:\n\u2022\tStrengthening governance institutions from community to national Government levels;\n\u2022\tImproving incomes and generating employment;\n\u2022\tImproving the policy environment and planning capabilities;\n\u2022\tProtecting Nepal's development gains from the ill-effects of natural disasters, climate change and HIV; and\n\u2022\tEmpowering women and disadvantaged people and fostering policies for equity and equality.\n\nWithin this framework, our Programmes address six priority areas for Nepal's development:\n\u2022\tTransitional Governance \n\u2022\tInclusive Growth & Sustainable Livelihood\n\u2022\tPeace Building and Recovery \n\u2022\tEnergy, Environment and Natural Disaster Management\n\u2022\tHIV \n\nUNDP's activities span almost 75 districts and 1,000 out of 4,000 villages. The number of projects ongoing in 2011 is 29. Of the $30.5 million spent in 2011, almost $22m came from UNDP sources and bilateral\/multilateral agencies. The main donor partner were DFID and Norway, Global Fund and DANIDA which funded 23\u0025 of programme expenditure.\n","category_list":[{"id":"2600","name":"Organization"}],"cover":{"cover_id":"848515098575046","source":"https:\/\/scontent.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-xta1\/v\/t1.0-9\/s720x720\/11141109_848515098575046_714425533774431403_n.jpg?oh=770eb2a840b9f03a45139c39a9e10775&oe=55DD239C","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"founded":"1963"},{"category":"Non-governmental organization (ngo)","id":"432785446737470","name":"Teach for Nepal","likes":96879,"talking_about_count":1533,"were_here_count":105,"location":{"street":" Kupondole (Across from the Campion College)","city":"Lalitpur","country":"Nepal","zip":"","latitude":27.68349849209,"longitude":85.31527555542},"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/TeachForNepal","phone":"+977-1-5012014","website":"http:\/\/www.teachfornepal.org","description":"Teach for Nepal is a national movement of outstanding university graduates and young professionals in Nepal, and of Nepalis abroad, dedicated to end education inequity and providing quality education to all children in Nepal.\n\nTeach for Nepal is a response to a growing problem of educational inequity in our country.

By outsourcing, companies can focus on their core activities, cutting costs and increasing bottom line growth. Our offshore development services are focused at small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) offering end-to-end software development services on competitive terms.\n\nFor every project, we have a dedicated Technical Project Manager who liaises with the Client Technical Project Manager. The details of the project and requirements are discussed in detail. The Technical Project Manager then conveys these to the Team Lead who is based offshore. They formulate a high level Architecture document and analyze and design the application. The Client Technical Project Manager is kept updated on these developments and approves the developments. After this, the Team Lead briefs the Development team. The project then proceeds methodically, supported at every step by intensive documentation and strict adherence to specified guidelines. Every step of the development process is vetted by the Quality Analysis Team. The Quality Analysis Team and the Development Team interact on a continuous basis at every stage. The Team Lead however, is the only conduit of contact for the onsite Project Manager and the Development team. This helps to banish any ambiguity and confusion that may exist.","category_list":[{"id":"2255","name":"Computers\/Technology"}],"cover":{"cover_id":"732269693519934","source":"https:\/\/fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net\/hphotos-ak-xpf1\/t31.0-8\/s720x720\/10355698_732269693519934_5764909502723370948_o.jpg","offset_y":40,"offset_x":0}},{"category":"School","id":"287450121417375","name":"Ullens School","likes":2318,"talking_about_count":76,"were_here_count":464,"location":{"street":"Khumaltar","city":"Lalitpur","country":"Nepal","zip":"","latitude":27.6667,"longitude":85.3333},"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/theUllensSchool","phone":"+97715570724","website":"http:\/\/www.ullens.edu.np\/","description":"The Ullens School is a not-for-profit institution established in 2006, with a vision to become a Center of Excellence in Education by the Ullens Education Foundation.

CARE places special focus on working alongside poor women because, equipped with the proper resources, women have the power to help whole families and entire communities escape poverty. Women are at the heart of CARE\u2019s community-based efforts to improve basic education, prevent the spread of disease, increase access to clean water and sanitation, expand economic opportunity and protect natural resources. CARE also delivers emergency aid to survivors of war and natural disasters, and help people rebuild their lives.\n\nIn the fiscal year 2013, CARE worked in 87 countries around the world, supporting 927 poverty-fighting development and humanitarian aid projects to reach more than 97 million people.\n\nCARE Nepal\nCARE has been working in Nepal since 1978. Its initial focus was on addressing the basic needs of the poor and vulnerable communities through infrastructure development, agriculture extension activities and natural resource management. This focus changed in the 1990s with the introduction of a more diversified portfolio and a community-based \u2018human infrastructure development\u2019 approach. Since 2000, CARE Nepal has been working in partnership with local NGOs, networks, federations and community groups to address the underlying causes of poverty, conflict and vulnerability through promotion of gender and social inclusion, a rights-based approach and social mobilisation.\n\nIn 2013, CARE Nepal implemented 19 community development projects in 48 districts in partnership with over 50 NGOs and hundreds of community groups. CARE Nepal currently works in the following areas:\n\n\u2022\tClimate Change and Natural Resource Management\n\u2022\tDisaster Risk Reduction and Emergency Response\n\u2022\tFood Security\n\u2022\tHIV and AIDS\n\u2022\tMaternal\/Child\/Family Health Services\n\u2022\tFormal and Popular\/Informal Education\n\u2022\tRural Infrastructure\/Quick Impact Programme\n\u2022\tPeace Building\n\u2022\tPsychosocial Wellbeing of Women\n\u2022\tRural Micro-Financing\n\u2022\tWater and Sanitation\n\u2022\tEconomic Opportunities\n\u2022\tAdvocacy and policy engagement\n\u2022\tStrengthening the Civil Society\n\nGender equity and diversity, social inclusion and governance remain as cross cutting strategies through all of CARE Nepal\u2019s work.\n\nCARE Nepal identifies three primary focus areas for its current programmes:\n\na. Women\u2019s Empowerment: Women\u2019s empowerment has been one of the most significant focus areas. CARE Nepal looks into the economic, social, political, and cultural aspects of women\u2019s lives, identify the challenges and carry out programs to mitigate them and support women. It has also been tracking achievements resulting from its intervention, for example, regarding the change in women\u2019s access to resources and change in their decision making abilities.\n\nb. Natural Resource Management\/Environment\/Securing Livelihoods: CARE Nepal seeks to enhance the access of PVSE communities including Dalits, the landless, women and those frequently affected by natural disasters and environmental degradation to natural resources along with improving their access to basic services such as health, education and economic opportunities.\n\nc. Addressing Issues of Equity and Justice: CARE Nepal engages communities on issues of inequity and justice, challenges harmful traditional beliefs and aids in raising awareness. Policy dialogue and advocacy is also an integral part of this focus area.  \n\nIn order to deliver relevant and lasting development results in Nepal, CARE Nepal has been designing and implementing its programmes based on the findings from its Underlying Causes of Poverty Analyses (UCPA). In the rapidly changing socio-political context of Nepal, CARE Nepal has demonstrated its capacity to adapt and consistently focus its programmes on ensuring that the rights of the PVSE population are understood, respected and addressed in positive ways. CARE\u2019s focus in Nepal and globally is to empower women and those who systematically face discrimination due to gender, caste, class, ethnicity and geographic settlement status.\n\nCARE Nepal has collaborated with organizations including the National Forum for Women Rights Concern (NFOWRC), Federation of Community Forest User Groups (FECOFUN), Dalit NGO Federation (DNF), Nepal Federation of Indigenous Nationalities (NEFIN), National Association of People Living with HIV & AIDS (PLHA) Networks (NAP+N) and Disaster Preparedness Network (DP-Net) in order to amplify people\u2019s voice in policy dialogue. \n\nAt the district and community level, CARE Nepal has worked with local NGOs, district chapters of national networks and district line agencies.

Sometimes it can take just about one week to up to 8 weeks. \n\nQ: Shop XYZ sells the same for cheap!\nA: As said, you are free to choose your purchase decision. We will NEVER compromise quality. We too can import cheap and sell cheap, but that is something we are never going to do.

It is the only city of Nepal with the administrative status of Mahanagar (Metropolitan City), as compared to Upa-Mahanagar (Sub-Metropolitan City) or Nagar (City). Kathmandu is the core of Nepal's largest urban agglomeration located in the Kathmandu valley consisting of Lalitpur, Kirtipur, Madhyapur Thimi, Bhaktapur and a number of smaller communities. Kathmandu is also known informally as \"KTM\" or the \"tri-city\". According to the 2011 census, Kathmandu Metropolitan City has a population of 975,453 and measures.The city stands at an elevation of approximately in the bowl-shaped Kathmandu Valley of central Nepal. It is surrounded by four major mountains: Shivapuri, Phulchoki, Nagarjun, and Chandragiri. Kathmandu Valley is part of three districts (Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur), has the highest population density in the country, and is home to about a twelfth of Nepal's population.Historically, the Kathmandu Valley and adjoining areas were known as Nepal Mandala. Until the 15th century, Bhaktapur was its capital when two other capitals, Kathmandu and Lalitpur, were established. During the Rana and Shah eras, British historians called the valley itself \"Nepal Proper\". Today, Kathmandu is not only the capital of the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal, but also the headquarters of the Bagmati Zone and the Central Development Region of Nepal.","category_list":[{"id":"224455390913969","name":"City"}]},{"category":"Public places","id":"291455627674402","name":"COMEDY CORNER","likes":6522,"talking_about_count":648,"were_here_count":0,"location":{"street":"","city":"Jhapa","country":"Nepal","zip":"12345","latitude":27.6717762685,"longitude":85.3021120192,"located_in":"571384369559922"},"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/COMEDY-CORNER\/291455627674402","description":"It teaches u to enjoy ur busy tired life and gives the reason to live tackling all the struggles providing you the comedys by the comedians of different corner.","category_list":[{"id":"2522","name":"Public Places"}],"cover":{"cover_id":"296234133863218","source":"https:\/\/fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net\/hphotos-ak-xpf1\/v\/t1.0-9\/s720x720\/10155360_296234133863218_774762744_n.jpg?oh=11d55c6b88d16558bfeb02956700c8a4&oe=55E59473&__gda__=1438831794_db8bd44337423ac355979d8dba91709b","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}},{"category":"Club","id":"223036091091866","name":"Nirvana Wellness Centre","likes":13263,"talking_about_count":20,"were_here_count":0,"location":{"street":"","city":"Jawalakhel","country":"Nepal","zip":"44700","latitude":27.671223891931,"longitude":85.310958320889},"link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/nirvanawellnesscentre","phone":"+977 1 5530443, 5542121","website":"http:\/\/www.nirvanawellnesscentre.com","description":"Maintaining a healthy and balanced lifestyle isn\u2019t complicated \u2013 there are just three main steps: exercise, a balanced diet and rest.
