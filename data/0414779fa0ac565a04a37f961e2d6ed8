First of all, we had hot water in the shower after almost two weeks of hot buckets, and not only that but we also had a great dinner which included yak made steak and Bob Marley music in the dining room. \nBottom line is, very well recommended place to be after a few tough days. The best guest house I've been in all along Annapurna Circuit.\nNadav Michael, Israel",
