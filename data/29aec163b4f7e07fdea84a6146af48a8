            "text" : "Area has seen much faster development . The agricultural lands were transformed into residential colonies. Area has developed a lot as residential societies. with almost all basic facilities. Condition of a roads has approved since last 2 years, but the actual progress of work has to start yet. The street lighting of the internal roads is a necessity. Work on Sewerage system is yet to start for all the colonies. The rain water drainage system is yet to be developed for whole of the region. Health facilities in the area is improving with a number of small and medium sized hospitals catering to its primary health needs.I am not sure whether ambulance facility is available by any means in the area. It also has some private schools, including St Karen's and Gyan Niketan High School. A few engineering, pharmacy and Dental colleges are located close by. Power cuts of hours at a stretch are very common. Power cuts are still an issue need to be addressed. Last but not the least I love this place because of my sweet home situated here.There is no other better place in the world, than being in the comfort of our homes. So this is the best place in spite of all Pros and Cons. We all residents should try hard to make this place a better place to live a comfortable and easy life.",
