It Is not that the products are bad, they are really good. But as I came to know that all of these products need a little after sale servicing for optimal performance that are lacking, not trying to put a fine point. It is almost impossible to reach their customer care service number, they do not respond to emails. In other words, you can not contact them. Unless of course you know someone who have a backdoor and I do not. I also want to point out that this is not an unfair criticism; I have tried to call them at least over 30 times at different times. Also send at least 4 emails. Hope this helps.",
