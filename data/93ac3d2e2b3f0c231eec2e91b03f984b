            "text" : "I recently bought an Ertiga VXI on 6th March 2014 (Thursday) from their Malviya Nagar (Savitri Nagar) and my experience with this dealership was one of the worst a customer can ever get. Firstly no one at the time of delivery was bothered to ensure proper delivery standards met before letting me drive away my purchase and also no one was least bothered to ensure give a brief about the functions in the car. Secondly- As per the deal I was entitled for free accessories worth Rs. 8,000/- (Rupees eight thousand only), most of the accessories were which I needed were not available I still agreed to get things which the dealer said were available and later was told out the items I was committed (Gear Lock, Door Visors, Side Beading, Bumper Guards, Mats, Diviniti Idol, Door Steel Strips and Steering Cover), at that time could only manage to put the Mats, Door Visors, Steering Cover and the gear lock and was promised that can come in on Sunday (9th March 2014) and get the rest pending accessories installed. On Sunday, I called up the Sales guy (Tarun Bhardwaj) and he confirmed  that would need a couple of more days to receive the due accessories. Then I got a call on Friday (14th March) confirming if need the accessories can come and get them installed till 6:30 pm, I told him could not reach by that time would come on Sunday (16th March) but is he sure that has all the accessories available. He confirmed the availability and on Sunday when I was almost there called this Sales guy again to confirm his availability and the pending accessories availabilty and he confirmed that all things were available. I reached the showroom and then they start giving me excuses that just have the side door beadings available and for the rest would need to come back in a 7 to 10 days. I without getting anything installed just left from there thanking them for their tremendous Customer support and ensuring them will never be back for those accessories again, they could keep it as a gift from my side as a token of being sorry to have chosen them as a dealership to buy my car from them this time. \n\nI have bought 5 other Maruti Cars from Rana Motors in past 5 years and never experienced such pathetic customer support. I recommend all people planning to buy cars from this dealership please try from some other dealership other than AAA Vechicleades.\n\nJugal Manaktala\n\n",
