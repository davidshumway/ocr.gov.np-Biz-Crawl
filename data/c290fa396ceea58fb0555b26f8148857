            "text" : "I've spent over three months in the Royal Astoria over a few different trips in 2013 and 2014. It is my go-to place to stay in Kathmandu. You would end up paying a lot more per room if you wanted to stay in a hotel of the same quality in Thamel, and really who wants to stay in Thamel? The hotel is 10-20 min by taxi from Thamel so it is easy to visit. And if you wander north you can quickly get into rice paddies and Shiva Puri National Park which is great for trail running and hikes (check it out on wikipedia). The staff are great, really nice marble floors, showers run hot, the deluxe rooms have nice little kitchens. Nice sitting room and terrace and garden. The food is fast and actually really good. If the power is working room AC blows cold and there is sat tv. Watch out on the VAT and service charges but you will get that in any tourist place. Cons - the rooms on the side facing the school can be noisy in the morning when school is in session, they don't always turn on the generator when the city power is out and you are the only person in the hotel, food choices within walking distance are a bit of an adventure (also a pro), and the place can be a little tricky for a taxi (or you) to find the first couple times. Arranging a taxi through the hotel is worth it for this convenience - if only a couple more bucks. Overall - a great place to stay.  The food is great, try their french fries! ",

Perfect for those who want to relax away from the chaos of Thamel, but still within walking distance of great Kathmandu sites, as well as a short and cheap taxi ride away from downtown. Popular ex-pat area, and close to embassies and the airport. A good oasis in Kathmandu. Great views from the rooms' balconies, and a nice walk to Kopa Monastery. I could also see it as a great place for families (safe, nice garden and lawn, clean), business functions (large conference room, catering kitchen, friendly staff), and even a long term stay (kitchens in some rooms, located in a nice neighborhood, quiet nights).
