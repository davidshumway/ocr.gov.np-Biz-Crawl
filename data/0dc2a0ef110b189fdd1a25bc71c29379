            "text" : "I bought a book shelf from this shop for  huge sum of 22000. the make is e zorin. Within one week of its installation, the problem started with the opening of drawers . You cannot open all the drawers one time. For opening these you need to lift some, apply force and then only it will open.\nAfter problem appeared , I am following up with the shop for last two months. It seems they do not have any service in spite of the fact that the product is covered in warranty for one year. I have been to shop 4-5 times, called them 3-4 time but always they give excuses and give me next date they will attend the problem. \nNow I am planning to approach the consumer forum for legal action against the manufacturer and the supplier.\nAll readers : Do not buy any pre assembled furniture - Its look is good but quality is very cheap. If buy , get from any reputed supplier and not from any promotional fair as the reputation of the shop is questionable.\n",
