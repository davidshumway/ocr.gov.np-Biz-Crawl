As a beginner mountain biker the trail was a little challenging, but it was surrounded by beautiful nature. I got to see a different side of Pokhara than the touristy downtown. The price is very reasonable considering the time and effort the team had to put into the trip and cheaper than all the other activities in pokhara that I've encountered so far. I would highly recommend this company to bikers and anyone who likes the outdoors and wouldn't mind a little physical exercise.",
