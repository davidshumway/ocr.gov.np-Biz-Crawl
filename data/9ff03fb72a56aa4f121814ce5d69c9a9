But in my first paid service I reliazed these guys try to rip you off by saying parts will not last soon and push you to spend money on unnecessary things giving them fancy names. Be ware you need to use your brain while making decision to buy parts from them or not . Could be possible that all your parts will last longer and they are pushing you to change to make money \n\n",

On the other hand I could get discount more than Rs 1700 as my labour charges were approx. Rs 3500. I asked then but they didn’t offer me discount.\n\n3) After service they asked me to fill feedback form , I gave my rating 8 in each points. Then I refused to fill feedback form and come out, but still they manage to force me for good feedback.\n\n4) Today 19-Feb-15 I got call from there they told me that one of their technician will visit my place to check gear shift issue , but still nobody turned up.\n\n5) Today 26th Feb still no body turned up for gear shift issue.\n\nI would rate Crown Honda  worst service provider of Honda.\n\nPlease beware before going to avail services of Crown Honda.\n",
