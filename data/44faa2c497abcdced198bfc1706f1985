I definitely needed help from someone to guide and advise me, carry by haversack, provide me with good facilities and most importantly, all these at a reasonable price. I just cannot depend on my friends. A friend from Germany had done this trip and strongly recommended me Sanjib Adhikari. I trusted my friend, took the advice and I did not regret. The warm welcome was felt right from the time they received me at the airport and for the next twelve days, until I said goodbye. Everything was taken care of to my utmost satisfaction. I cannot compare with other service providers as I had not used them but as far as I am concerned, Sanjib Team is excellent enough. Thank you Mr Sanjib and Raj for the excellent hospitality. I will be back",
