Solitarily located, on the outskirts of the hustling city Thamel. A peaceful and a, wonderful destination to dine and feel divine. Top class services personalized attention and round the clock attendance makes you feel jubilant and comfortable all the time. Hotel Ganesh Himal has always been a trademark of excellence and probably one of the oldest among many others rendering notable warm hospitality for decades.\n\nFantastic and unbelievable is what I can say about Hotel Ganesh Himal, last time when I was here got the finest of reception and welcome right from the entrance till my scheduled stay of 3 days. Memories are still fresh in my mind as I was never made to wait unnecessarily for smallest of things everything was in order and flawless. Ganesh Himal made my stay worthwhile and I got every worth of my money that I spent. The crew members the housekeeping staff, the security guard and other supporting staff were very friendly and cooperative. Regardless of my origin and background never ever gave a room of suspicion reluctance or discrimination, everything was smooth and wonderful.\n\nMy heart and thoughts goes to Ganesh Himal its owner and its staff members, and if I am around Nepal again I would like to be sheltered one more time in a place of complete profound service and peace \n",
