I lived with a host family, who treated me like a member of the family.  We ate together and I was able to truly experience rural Nepal.  In terms of the volunteer work, I worked with other international volunteers, as well as local volunteers and community members to build a water tank.  The goal was to provide a reliable source of water for 25 families.  In two weeks, we excavated the hillside, and constructed the water tank.  It was an incredible opportunity to help others and gain insight into the challenges faced by other communities (and truly appreciate all the advantages I have as an American).\n\nI highly recommend VIN as an effective organization, working with the communities and would encourage anyone to donate money and time to them.  With the devastating effects of the earthquake, it is more important than ever to support their efforts.  ",

The VIN staff was very kind!\nMy volunteer experience teaching English at the monastery was incredible. At first the monks were very shy, but they warmed up and made volunteering such a great experience. My only regret was not staying longer!  \nSomething that I had not thought I would get out of volunteering but certainly happy I did was meeting and making friendships with the other volunteers from all over the world. \nI would definitely recommend VIN to anyone who wants to volunteer in Nepal. \n",
