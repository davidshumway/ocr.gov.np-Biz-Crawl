The village is surrounded by Chovar in the east, Taudaha in the south, Kirtipur in the north and Jakha in the west. Charghare's main tourist places are Jalpadevi Temple and slopy land (\u092b\u093e\u0901\u091f). It covers the area of 4 or 5 km2. (approx.). Around 90 houses are found here. The population of this village is about 470. Houses are of traditional type but new houses are constructed in modern style. Most people are engaged in Agriculture and Trade.HistoryThere isn't any accurate information or documents that have been found on the origin of village. When, the village was established is still unknown because of insufficient sources of knowledge. It is believed that the village originated during the period of the Unification Campaign by King Prithvi Narayan Shah. The King's main aim was to capture the Kathmadu Valley, but to win Kathmandu Valley over he had to defeat the Kirtipur Valley. So he brought a large number of troops from the west to attack the Kirtipur Valley. But he failed twice to take over city. After a heavy loss of troops and his 'right-hand' Kalu Pandey, he started to conquer the small states around Kirtipur to impose economic strike. During those days Charghare was unnamed and open plain land. Some people migrated or mar be troops who has came for battle form western part who started to settlement with the four houses(\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u0918\u0930) in village. Later pronounced of Char ghar(\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u0918\u0930) changed into Charghare(\u091a\u093e\u0930\u0918\u0930\u0947) which consequenced the name of village as Charghare.

Despite being very close to Kathmandu, the Langtang Region is as wild as any Tibetan highlands with idyllic rural landscape. The people living in the highlands of the Langtang region are certainly Nepalese but being the descendant of the Tibetan origin, they look like the Tibetans. Hence, Langtang region is one of the most popular trekking regions for those wishing a short trek from Kathmandu into the Himalayas influenced by Tibetan lifestyle. Moreover, accompanying with the varieties of rhododendron, bamboo forests, majestic waterfalls and snow-capped Himalayas make the trek one of the most diverse treks nearby Kathmandu.\n\nThe Langtang Valley Trek starts with a Bus or Jeep ride from Kathmandu to Syabrubesi. We begin the walk from Syabrubesi. We head upward to Lama Hotel and Langtang village until we arrive at the famous Kanyanjing Gompa. After exploring the region, we trek the same route to Syabrubesi from where we drive back to Kathmandu.","category_list":[{"id":"162914327091136","name":"Travel
