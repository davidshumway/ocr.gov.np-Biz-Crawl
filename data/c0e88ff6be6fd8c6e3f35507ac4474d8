            "text" : "This is what they say about themselves:\n\nExclusive Imported Furniture Showroom chain providing home and office furniture, modular kitchens and Interior Design services. Leading brands in imported furniture in India at convenient locations.\n\nThe truth is they sell products over priced and claim that they have been made with German Machine. The  exterior design may look nice but the quality of the  products are cheap.  I have uploaded the pictures of the materials and hopefully they will speak volume for themselves. \nHere is my shopping experience.\nThe process usually involves booking of furniture by paying 40-50 percent of the price. And then making the complete payment before the sofa is delivered. I bought a L shaped Sofa at approximately 60 K INR supposedly with lot of discount from 1 Lakh INR. I know I have been cheated but hopefully this post will help future consumers while buying from this store. \n\nThe sofa was delivered on time rather much before the normal delivery time which is really praiseworthy but what followed later was something unknown to any one who will dole out such a huge amount money for such a piece of junk.\n\nThe German machine made sofa was delivered by the delivery team which was covered in a single wrapping of cloth. We had no idea what was inside expect for the fact that I was hoping that it was the grand furniture that we saw in the showroom customized exclusively for us. The 2 pieces of sofa were dumped on top of each other and we were told a separate group of professionals will be at our place to arrange the sofa , provide fittings and fix the sofa in the house . \nNext day two young boys came to our house stating that they are professionals who will fix the sofa . The sofa was dumped upside down.They unwrapped sofa from its wrapping. Please note that the sofa was not covered all around with some kind of padding's or protective covering. They immediately unwrapped another little box took out some metallic legs ( extremely cheap built attached it with plastic head for resting on the floor- Unfortunately I didn't take the picture of it yet). The had a little drilling machine using which they started screwing the legs to the sofa.  Till this point I thought the sofa is in good hands and I knew I somehow paid a little bit of premium but since I had so little time I was happy that I was able to complete this long pending task. Now after one leg was fixed I casually went towards the sofa and to my horror I found the black cloth lining at the bottom of the sofa ( this cloth actually hides the inside guts of the sofa) is ripped off hear and there. The cloth was cheap quality material and doesn't reflect that the sofa cost. And when I mentioned this to the boys who came to fix they confidently said it will be  changed. By this time I was upset as they didn't even bother to inform that the sofa is damaged but they are fixings legs on one corner of the sofa where this very black cloth is stiched. The entire cloth is stapled on the bottom of the sofa.  By this time I could only see the bottom of the sofa with the black cloth ripped off here and there. Then I proceeded to check the corners and I found the leather was sdamaged in the corner at 2 places. I checked the gut of the sofa and found the cheap construction of the material. The wood used was like most ordinary quality. Hopefully you can take a look a the pictures and decide whether its teak or mango wood.   The plywood used was real cheap quality. I am going to upload all the pictures.Hopefully it will help future customers.\n\nMobel India has promised to take back the damaged product and deliver me the undamaged product. But I had a chance to take a look  inside guts of the sofa. I have no doubt in my mind that they are a fraudulent business practice and have been ripping apart every consumer in Kolkata.  \n\nHere are the timelines: \n10/01/2014; Order \n11/01/2014 - Full payment\n14/01/2014: Delivery\n16/01/2014: Discovery of damaged product\n17/01/2014.- The picked up the product\n",

            "text" : "Their business model is - make the customer pay in advance and then squeeze. Service is extremely poor.\n\nOrdered 3 items\na) Dining table - ready made (imported from Thailand)\nb) Sofa - made to order\nc) TV Cabinet - made to order\n\na) was delivered immediately. Turned out to be assembled type (not informed to us earlier)\nb) Sofa - delayed but the wood is suspect - a slight pressure against the wall created a powdery residue and chipping. The seats are already sagging.\nc) Cabinet - after the order was placed and delivery promised last October, nothing was done and was told that we had to visit the showroom again to discuss. \n\nTime passed (9 mos)but they didn't bother to contact because they take payments upfront. Went today to their store and told them to cancel my Cabinet order. They refused. They still owe me about Rs 10K.\n\nThe sales guy talks sweet but only till the sale is made. We spent a lot of time explaining the dimensions we wanted but in the end they delivered what they liked ( totally ignored what we had requested).\n\nMy recommendation: avoid like the plague.",
