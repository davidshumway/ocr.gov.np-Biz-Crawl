            "text" : "I fail to understand why Pacific Motors located in Bareilly Uttar Pradesh allowed Channel Motors in Haldwani Uttarakhand to borrow a Fiat Punto to sell to us.  Channel Motors represented themselves as a Fiat Dealership.  Mr. Aayush Khanna brought the car to our home in Ghorakhal for a test drive.  He went as far as showing me a photo on his mobile phone of cars in a dealership showroom stating it just “opened yesterday”.  I have since been to Channel motors.  They have no such showroom.  Bareilly is 134 km from Ghorakhal.  I most definitely do not want to drive 3 ½- 4 hours one way to get it serviced. We chose to buy in Haldwani because it is much closer to us.\nOn top of that Channel Motors took our money as sat on it instead of proving the service they promised.  They also took money for the registration and number plate.  When we called asking where the number plate was they kept telling us it will be here tomorrow.  Come to find out they never sent the paperwork to the RTO in Haldwani until October.  We bought the car May 2. \n\nIt was only after we contacted Fiat India that some service work on the car was completed and we received a bill of sale and warranty papers.  Fiat India told us there was no Fiat Dealership in Haldwani. Imagine our surprise and discontent when we found out we were duped into buying a car from Pacific Motors in Bareilly.  Pacific Motors was listed in our bill of sale we finally received.\n\nDo you want to buy a car from this dealership?  Once Channel Motors had our money they failed to provide service to our car.  The side mirror fell of the odometer was not connected.  Tet did not process the paperwork for the number plate until we contacted Fiat India. I have no idea where we can get warranty work done on this car.  We are a 4 hour drive from Bareilly.  Pacific Motors did nothing to resolve the situation.\n\n",
